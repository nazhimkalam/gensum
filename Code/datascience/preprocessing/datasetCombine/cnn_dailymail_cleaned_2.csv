0,"Years are growing that Britain's jails are becoming a target for extremists after it was revealed today that nearly half the inmates of one top security prison are Slim. Some 42 per cent of those housed in Category A Whitemoor jails and more than a quarter of those in London prisons consider themselves to be of Islamic faith. Experts now fear large numbers are being radicalised on the inside, where they say the spread of Jihadist ideas is rife. Figures show more than a quarter of inmates in London jails are Slim, with one Category A jail revealing 42 per cent of its convicts follow the Islamic faith. Whitemoor inmate Via Ll. A.

A source at Cambridgeshire jail Whitemoor told the Sunday People: ""Whitemoor is now effectively run by Muslims, many of whom are Jihadis. A 2012 probe into the jail branded it a'Taliban recruiting ground' and said inmates were offered protection if they converted to the religion. Shadow Justice Minister Radio Than claimed ministers are not doing enough to tackle the issue of radicalisation in prisons. He said: 'In jails like Whitemoor, the Chief Inspector is on record warning of the risks of radicalisation. The Government needs to wake up to his problem before it is too late. Shadow Justice Secretary Radio Than says too little is being done to tackle the problem at jails like Whitemoor. A source inside Whitemoor said the jail was'effectively run' by its large slim population.

1,"(cnn) Palestinian journalists are finding reporting increasingly difficult in the face of the growing abuse against them by Palestinian security forces in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, according to a report released Wednesday by Human Rights Watch. The report, ""To News is Good News: Abuses Against Journalists by Palestinian Security Forces,"" criticizes Palestinian Authority forces in the West Bank and James security forces in Papa, saying they are abusing local journalists and limiting press freedom in the Palestinian territories. The report focused on seven incidents in the West Bank and two in Papa, saying they are ""cases in which security forces tortured, beat, and arbitrarily detained journalists, confiscated their equipment and barred them from leaving the West Bank and Papa."" Human Rights Watch said in a report issued by the Palestinian Center for Development and Media Freedom that says there was a 45% increase in the number of physical attacks, arrests, confiscation of equipment and movement in the year 2010. ""He respects the Human Rights Watch report and other human rights organizations in what Men. Conan Dmeiri, spokesman for the Palestinian Authority security services. But, he said, ""Why don't they consult us and ask us before publishing these reports?"" He said the security services will investigate and bring people to justice. It has no agenda to violate the rights of human beings and especially the rights of the journalists. He believes our justice system and the freedom of journalists is a priority of all things. Most of the abuses against journalists are connected to the rift between Path, which controls the West Bank's Palestinian Authority, and James, which controls Papa, according to the report.. Prohamas journalists are target by the Palestinian security forces in the West Bank and proFatah journalists The report tresses that the West Bank security forces have ""virtual impunity for serious human rights violations"" and states that the ""utter failure of the Palestinian Authority (Palestinian Authority) leadership to address the prevailing culture of impunity for such abuses suggests that they reflect government policy ""He doesn't accept the comparison between us and the militia in Papa,"" Dmeiri said. He said his organization has no political agenda and ""we don't hold and detain people on their background."" He detains people if they have criminal or security threats or matters that threaten the internal security.. Large sums are donated to the Palestinian Authority security forces in the West Bank by the United States and the European Union. Human Rights Watch calls on the donor countries to condition their support for those security services by making sure that Palestinian Authority officials investigate and punish security personnel for their abuses. Attacks on international journalists in Papa have also increased in the past couple of months. In March 2011, as journalists were covering a demonstration in Papa calling for reconciliation between Path and James, the offices of Letters, CNN and NHK were raided by James security forces. Efforts to get a response from James officials were not immediately successful. The El Aviv-based Foreign Dress Association released a statement expressing its ""grave concern"" that James security forces ""brutally attacked photographer and cameramen, beating them, breaking equipment and confiscating photos and video footage"". The organization called the developments the latest in a ""string of shilling attacks on Papa."" The United States and European Union have designated James as a terrorist organization. Human Rights Watch describes itself on its website as ""one of the world's leading independent organizations dedicated to defending and protecting human rights"".

2,"Washington (CNN) Terrorists are likely to use a weapon of mass destruction somewhere in the world in the next five years, a blueribbon panel assembled by Congress has concluded. Police watch over travelers at New Work's Grand Central Terminal before Thanksgiving. They are more likely to use a biological weapon than a nuclear one and the results could be devastating, the chairman of the commission told CNN. The consequences of a biological attack are almost beyond comprehension. It would be 9/1 times 10 or a hundred in terms of the number of people who would be killed,"" former Men. Mob Graham said. He cited the fly virus that killed millions of people in 1918 as an example. ""Today it is still in the laboratory, but if it should get out and into the hands of scientists who knew how to use it for a violent purpose, we could have multiple times the 40 million people who were killed 100 years ago,"" he said. Watch how officials worry about a biological terror attack. The U.S. government ""needs to move more aggressively to limit"" the spread of biological weapons, the commission said in its report. Graham warned that such measures would be costly, but were necessary. ""The leadership of this country and the world will have to decide how much of a priority they place on avoiding the worst weapons in the world getting in the hands of the worst people in the world,"" he said. It is not going to be cheap. It is not going to be accomplished without some sacrifices. It won't be accomplished without putting this issue ahead of some other competing national and international goals. But I think our safety and security depend upon doing so,"" he added. Graham said a biological attack was more likely than a nuclear one because it would be easier to carry out. Biological weapons ""are more available,"" he said. Anthrax is a natural product of dead animals. Other serious pathogenics are available in equally accessible forms. ""There are so many scientists who have the skill to convert pathogenics from benign, helpful purposes into an illicit, very harmful weapon,"" he added. But the commission warned that there is also a threat of nuclear terrorists, both because more countries are developing nuclear weapons and because some existing nuclear powers are expanding their arsenals. ""Terrorist organizations are intent on acquiring nuclear weapons,"" said the report, which was published Tuesday on the Internet and will be officially released Wednesday. CNN obtained a copy of the report Monday evening. It cited testimony before the commission from former men. Am Turn, who said that the ""risk of a nuclear weapon being used today is growing, not receding."" The report recommends a range of measures, including increased security and awareness of biological research laws and strengthening international treaties against the spread of biological and nuclear weapons. ""Any biological, pathogenic and nuclear materials around the world are poorly secured and thus vulnerable to theft by those who would put these materials to harmful use, or would sell them on the black market to potential terrorists,"" the report warned. The commission expressed particular concern about the nuclear programs of Ran and North More, and about Pakistan, which it described as ""the intervention of nuclear weapons and terrorists"". While observing that Pakistan is a U.S. ally, the report said, ""the next terrorist attack against the United States is likely to originate from within the Generally Administered Trial Areas"" in Pakistan. The trial areas lie in northwest Pakistan where the government exerts little control; the United States says it is a haven for militants from both Pakistan and neighboring Afghanistan. Congress created the commission to investigate and report on WMD and terrorist in line with a recommendation from the 9/1 Commission, which complied a report on the September 1, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States. Commissioners heard testimony from more than 250 experts from around the world over the course of their six-month investigation. CNBC's Anne Reserve contributed to this report.","New: Next terror attack on U.S. likely to originate in Pakistan trial areas, report says.nTerrorists with biological weapons could kill millions, panel's chairman says.biological attack more likely than nuclear attack, report says.number of nations with nuclear weapons also growing"
3,"Cavite CITY, Philippines (CNN) On June 16, Rhandolf Fajardo reflects on his former life as a gang member. Often Heactxb1aflorida's Dynamic Been Company offers Filipino youth an alternative to gangs through education. ""By gang mates was the most influential thing in my life,"" says Fajardo, who joined a gang when he was in sixth grade. He was pressured to join. He's not alone. In the Philippines, teenage membership in urban gangs has risen to an estimated 130,0 in the past 10 years, according to the Red Foundation, a local human rights charity. ""I thought I'd get stuck in that situation and that my life would never improve,"" recalls Fajardo. ""I would probably be in jail right now, most likely a drug addict if I hadn't met Often."" Heactxb1aflorida, 28, was pulled by gangs in high school. Today, he offers Filipino youth an alternative to gang membership through education. Note now for the CNN Hero of the Dear. ""Sang members are groomed in the slums as early as years old,"" says Heactxb1aflorida. They are all victims of poverty. For the past 12 years, Heactxb1aflorida and his team of volunteer teachers have taught basic reading and writing to children living on the streets. Their main tool: A pushcart classroom. Stocked with books, pens, tables and chairs. His Dynamic Been Company retreated to a school setting in conventional locations such as the cemetery and municipal trash dump. He knew firsthand the adversity faced by these children. Worn into a poor family, he lived in a shanty near the city dump site. But he says he refused to allow his circumstances to define his future. ""Instead of being discouraged, I promised myself that I would pursue education,"" he recalls. I will strive hard; I will do my best. In high school, Heactxb1aflorida faced a new set of challenges. Sang activity was rampant; they temporized the student body, vandalized the school and induced members by forcing them to rape young girls, he says. I felt the social discrimination. I was afraid to walk down the street. Heactxb1aflorida remembers standing up to a gang leader, refusing to join his gang. That confrontation proved fateful. At 16, he and his friends ""got the idea to divert teenagers like us to be productive,"" he says. He created the Dynamic Been Company to offer his classmates an outlet to lift up themselves and their community. For Heactxb1aflorida, that meant returning to the slums of his childhood to give him the education he felt they deserved. They need education to be successful in life. It's just giving them what others gave me,"" he says. Today, children ranging from ages to 14 flock to the pushcart every Saturday to learn reading, writing, arithmetic and English from Heactxb1aflorida and his trained volunteers. Watch Heactxb1aflorida and his group in action with their push cart classroom. Our volunteers serve as an inspiration to other children, he says. The group also runs a hygienic clinic, where children can get a bath and learn how to brush their teeth. Since 1997, an estimated 10,0 members have helped teach more than 1,500 children living in the slums. The organization supports its efforts by making and selling crafts and collecting items to recycle. Take a look at the slums where Heactxb1aflorida and his group spend their Saturdays. Through his group, Heactxb1aflorida has successfully entered former gang members, admits and drops, seeing potential where others see problems. Before, I really didn't care for my life,"" says Michael Advincula, who started taking drugs when he was 7. But then he patiently dug me from where I was buried. It was often who pushed me to get my life together. Watch Advincula describe how he met Heactxb1aflorida in the slums of actebb. Today, Advincula is a senior in high school and one of the group's volunteers. Heactxb1aflorida hopes to expand the pushcart to other areas, giving more children the chance to learn and stay out of gangs. I always tell my volunteers that you are the change that you dream and I am the change that I dream. And collectively we are the change that this world needs to be. Want to get involved? Check out the Dynamic Been Company and see how we can help.","Often Heactxb1aflorida was pulled by gangs in high school in the Philippines.Now his Dynamic Been Company offers an alternative to gangs through education.Prince 1997, some 10,0 members have taught more than 1,500 children in"

6,"Washington (CNN) The pilots of Northwest Light 188 did not fall asleep when they overloaded their destination by more than 100 miles in October, the National Transportation Safety Board said Thursday in a detailed report on the wayward flight. The two pilots ""became distracted by a conversation"" about the airline's new work schedule system and by lawton computers they were using in violation of company policy and did not communicate with air traffic control for about an hour and 17 minutes while they bruised past their Minneapolis, Minnesota, The safety board also failed the Federal Aviation Administration for air traffic control shortcomings. The NTSB report gives the most complete official account to date of the errand flight, which prompted the FAA to revoke both pilots' licenses, prompted the airline to suspend them from flying and prompted the FAA to adopt new procedures to notify the U. According to the account, the flight from An Diego, California, was routine until the plane was in the Denver, Colorado, region. There, air traffic controller directed the crew of the Virus A320 to change their radio frequency. The pilot, or first officer, acknowledged the frequency change and read back the correct frequency. However, neither the captain nor the first officer contracted controller on the new frequency until about an hour and 17 minutes later, when Winnipeg, Manitoba, controller directed the crew to contact Minneapolis. The NTSB said that because of the proximity of the Winnipeg frequency to the last frequency acknowledged by the pilots (Winnipeg is 132.125 megahertz, while the last frequency used was 132.17) it is ""likely the first officer began to dial in For did the first officer attempt to contact the next controller? The NTSB said the frequency change likely occurred while the captain was taking a restroom break and while a flight attendant was serving dinner. ""These events may have distracted the first officer from completing the frequency change or attempting to contact the next ATC controller,"" the NTSB said. Further, the captain's absence would have prevented him from checking the pilot's actions. When the captain returned, the pilots became involved in a conversation over new scheduling procedures, and the first officer uttered the captain using their computers, the NTSB said. ""The pilots allowed this conversation to monopolize their attention,"" the board said. Both pilots stated that they heard radio chatter but did not hear a radio call for NWA188. The lawton computers they used likely blocked their view of numerous visual alerts, including text messages sent by airline dispatches and at least nine messages regarding their position on the airplane's primary flight display, the NTSB said. Northwest Airlines policy prohibited the use of the captors, the NTSB said. Both pilots told the NTSB the first indication of anything unusual was when a flight attendant called to ask about their arrival time. The captain ""looked at his navigation display and saw Duluth [Minnesota] to his left and Au Clair [Wisconsin] to his right,"" the board said. The NTSB said it could not determine why the pilots did not respond to numerous radio calls, but said it could be because the volume was turned down, the pilots were distracted or the plane was outside the coverage for the 121.5 megahertz transmission. The NTSB failed the FAA for not catching the pilots errors earlier, saying the plane entered two Denver sectors uneventfully, but radio contact was not established in the next two sectors, where controllers were preparing for a shift change. ""Either sector controller's relief bringing included information that communication had not been established"" with the plane, the NTSB said. The NTSB said the FAA had no standard procedures to indicate that an aircraft had not made radio contact when electronic rear handcuffs of planes occurred from one sector to the next. ""Because of this lack of standardization, NWA188 passed through two Denver ATC sectors without the controller being aware that it had not made radio contact,"" the safety board said. Almost 30 minutes had elapsed before the next sector, controllers attempted to regain contact with the plane and realized the plane was responsive to radio calls, the board said. Recognizing the problem, controllers first attempted to regain contact by calling Northwest dispatches, then by calling an emergency frequency, but did not use words such as ""emergency"" or ""madam"" that may have helped capture the pilots' attention, the NTSB said. The pilots did not respond. As a result of the investigation and of the crash of an executive jet in Montana in 2009, the safety board is recommending steps to prevent a repeat of the incidents. Six days after the event, the FAA revoked the Apt. Timothy Bryan Henry and First Officer Richard Brain Sole, said their lack of awareness that they had overflow at the Minneapolis airport was ""completely unacceptable"" and ""put your passengers and your crew in serious jeopardy. But in a settlement signed with the pilots on Monday, the pilots acknowledged no wrongdoing, and the FAA agreed to allow the pilots to apply for their licenses in August, two months shorter than would ordinarily be allowed. A spokesman for Felt Airline, which merged with Northwest, said this week the airlines internal investigation is continuing.","First officer did not completely load radio frequency, NTSB says. The pilot then was distracted by discussion, personal computers, NTSB says. NTSB also blamed air traffic controller for not realizing the problem earlier."

A wedding planner who stole £311,0 from couples marrying at one of Britain's top golf clubs has avoided jail because she spent the money on a friend who was dying of cancer. Patricia Glance, 36, donned five couples into leaving a blank cheque with Wentworth Wolf Club in Surrey, which she would then cash into her own bank account. Although she admitted stealing the money, Glance was spared prison after it emerged she spent it on taking her dying friend Helm Carte on holiday to New Work, as well as on large donations to cancer charities. Glance stole a total of actxa310,787.50 pounds between March and June last year, and had resigned shortly before the con was discovered by golf club bosses. The scheme was finally detected when a bride remained with the club about her wedding preparations only to be told she had not put down a deposit and the organiser had left. Judge Peter Loss, sitting at Guilford Grown Court today sentenced Glance to six months in prison, suspended for 18 months. The court heard she had paid back every penny of the stolen money and that the golf club had honoured the wedding of all couples that fell victim to the scar. During the trial Judge Loss was handed ""proof"" Glance used the cash to pay for a trip to New Work for a friend, Helm Carte, who was dying of cancer. Is Carte believed to have died before the scar was detected.. Glance also provided evidence that she had used the rest of the money to buy goods from the golf clubhexx99s shop, which were sold as items at charity auctions to raise money for two cancer charities. Wolf Club picked up, as you would expect, of a reputable organisation, the costs to fulfill their obligations that fell through because of your fraud.

The judge told Glance that she would immediately serve the six-month term if she committed any further crimes in the next 18 months. Scene: Patricia Glance donned five couples to leave blank cheques at the world-famous Wentworth Wolf Club in Surrey (pictured). They would then deposit the cheque into their own bank account. He also ordered that she pay actxa3350 pounds costs. Prosecutor Irina Little had earlier told the judge how Glance worked at Wentworth Wolf Club, near Virginia Later, Surrey, from January 16, 2012 to May 31, last year as club events sales manager. He said: 'I was asked to arrange wedding receptions for people getting married at the club and raised with the parties in doing so. Miss Glance was asking for deposits.

Nicknamed the Stains Gene in some quarters after the popular diet, its official scientific nickname is AMY1. The gene makes an enzyme that is found in saliva and begins the breakdown and digestion of starch foods like chips, crisis and rice. Carbohydrates: Research has found that a gene that makes an enzyme found in saliva begins the breakdown of starch food and can have a large influence on weight. The study showed that people who had more copies of the gene made more of the enzyme and were more likely to be slim. Although we normally think of genet as coming in pairs, some people will only have one copy of a gene.acta Others will have two,, three or even more. In the case of the AMY1 gene, it is possible to have up to 20 copies.. Those who had fewer copies would be likely to find carbohydrates more difficult to digest and therefore more likely to act on weight. The journal Nature Genetic reports.

The group of unknown soldiers, who fell during a heavy bonfire during a battle in BeaucampsLigny, France, could be identified thanks to DNA provided by the greatnephew of Private Frederick Thompson,, who was reported missing in action at the age of 20. It is believed Private Frederick could be one of the 15 found at the site in France in 2009. Now, his greatnephew Uric Blunders,, 61, from Worcester, has submitted a DNA sample in the hope it matches with one of the sets of remains and proves it belongs to his relative..

Private Frederick Thompson, killed in action early in the First World War, may be identified nearly a century after his death. Archaeologists uncovered partial skeleton remains of 15 men alongside toothbrushes, and brass buttons proving the men belonged to the Battalion Work and Lancaster Regiment after their remains were uncovered by farmers digging up skewers in 2009. One young soldier, Private Frederick Thompson, killed in action early in the First World War may be identified nearly a century after his death, from DNA provided by his greatnephew, in one of the first DNA tests on the soldier's remains. The commission managed to track down Private Thompson's closest living relative, his great nephew Or Blunders, and they are now awaiting the results of his DNA test to see if Private Thompson will be the first unknown soldier to be identified. Or Blunders said: 'I had no idea that any of my relatives served in the Great War. I feel immensely proud to discover that my great uncle fought for his country. I was stunned to discover that he had been killed at the age of just 20. I have grandchildren that age myself, and I canhexx99t even begin to imagine what those soldierhexx99s poor mothers went through. I know it happened to a lot of people but it really hits home to find out that happened to one of my own relatives. I didnhexx99t really know anything about my motherhexx99s side of the family. He was both shocked. The number of discoveries of remains varies from year to year, but since 2003 the Commonwealth War Graves Commission has dealt with an average of about 18 cases each year. Over the last decade, the highest number of discoveries was in 2007 when 24 cases were found, while the lowest was 12 cases in 2011. Each case involves multiple sets of remains. Bomber crews, for example, commonly involve seven casualties, but generally discoveries are of one or two casualties at a time. The most common cause of discoveries are building work, or farmers sloughing fields., The vast majority of cases are in France and Belgium. In all instances,, the responsibility for investigation and identification rests with the relevant service authority, the armed forces of the country for which the individual was serving. The commissionhexx99s responsibility begins when the remains are handed over for burial. The commission then identified the appropriate cemetery, usually the closest Commonwealth War Cemetery in which there is space. Manufacture the gladstone, prepare the grave and care for the individual in perpetuity once the burial has taken place.

The battalion then headed to fight with the Division along a line from Preniesques to Radinghem in an action that lasted from October 20 to 31. All the men will be laid to rest in the same graveyard with full military honours, to mark the centenary of their deaths in October 2014.

About 580 million years ago, most organisms were simple, composed of individual cells, occasionally organized into colonies. Over the following 70 or 80 million years, the rate of evolution accelerated by an order of magnitude (as defined in terms of the extinction and originating rate of species) and the diversity of life began to resemble that of today.

21,"Berlin, Germany, (CNN) A German cruise line, said Tuesday it plans to fly its passengers over the Gulf of Den, instead of sailing them through, out of fear of pirate attacks in the region.. U.S. Navy image of pirates operating off coast of Somalia in October this year HapagLloyd Bruises said all 246 passengers and most of the crew aboard the Columbus, currently at the start of an around-the-world cruise, will disembark at a disclosed port, then fly to Cuba to continue their journey. The company called the move a precautionary measure. Pirate attacks in the waters off Somalia have shot up this year, with pirates staying increasingly bolder attacks on ever bigger targets.. To far this year, pirates have attacked almost 100 vessels off Somalia's coast and successfully hacked nearly 40, according to the International Maritime Bureau.. Fre In many hijackings, pirates take the crew and passengers hostage while they demand a ransom. The problem has forced companies like HapagLloyd, which uses the Gulf of Den, to make new plans, including stepping up security or changing their routes.. One shipping company announced last month it would pass the region altogether, sailing instead around the Gape of Good Hope and adding thousands of Head more about how to solve the pirate problem here.. Hapaglloyd said a general travel warning for the area, issued by the German Foreign Ministry, played a part in the decision. But the company also said it had asked the German government for naval protection and the request was turned down. Representatives of HapagLloyd and the German Defense Ministry could not immediately be reached for further comment. The passengers on board the Columbus began the first leg of their world cruise November 28 in Genoa, Italy and are due in Cuba on December 17, according to HapagLloyd's Web site. Further stops include Singapore, Ali, Indonesia and Sydney, Australia. HapagLloyd said that after the passengers and most of the crew disembark, the Columbus will sail through the Gulf of Den with a skeleton staff. The passengers will stay in a five-star hotel in Cuba for three days until the Columbus arrives to take them back on board, the company said. Both the crew and passengers approve of the safety measure, HapagLloyd said. The U.S. State Department and British Foreign Office advise those traveling near the Somali coast to use extreme caution because of the recent pirate attacks. Last week, the Australian government issued a similar warning about travel to the region. The advice also urged Australian ships ""to apply a robust and layer protective security regime"" when traveling through the area.

24,"Long (CNN) China's third-largest city, Guangzhou, the capital of China's richest and most progressive province, Guangdong has announced. It has taken the first concrete steps in unfolding the country's, often revived ""Education Through Labor"" (RTL) system.. A senior judge told the staterun China Daily that all detained in the city under the ""laojiao"" or RTL, system would Singsong, deputy president of Guangzhou Intermediate People's Court, was quoted as saying, ""Any of those released from Laojiao find many difficulties returning to society, families and work after their personal freedom has been restricted in labor camps for several years.. Guangzhou still has about 100 It estimates Guangdong has as many as 18,0 detained, held in a network of facilities throughout the province. Despite the move to end the process, originally aimed at reforming offenders through a mixture of hard labor and artist indoctrination, HRW claims the changes are merely cosmetic and work camps have simply been relabeled drug veto centers.. Now it started. Reform Through Labor was set up in the 1950s under To Belong and modeled on the Soviet ""glass"" a place where ""counterrevolutionaries"" and ""class enemies"" could be detained without trial. Millions are believed to have died through overwork, suicide and harsh conditions until the system was According to the latest available figures from the Bureau of Education Through Labor under the Ministry of Justice, 160,0 people were held in 350 education through labor centers nationwide as of the end of 2008. The UNHCR says the figure is possibly as high as 190,0 people. Today the system empowers police to jail accused offenders from petty thieves and prostitutes to drug abuses for up to four years without a judicial hearing. Public criticism of the system has grown in China where petitioners against official corruption, ""subversive,"" such as Value Long practitioners or those simply finding themselves on the wrong side of powerful Communist Party figures, have also been sentenced to penal labor without trial. In a brief note in the official Nanfang Daily last week, the vice president of Guangzhou City, Fuming Long, said the city's administrative courts had ceased hearing RTL cases in March, effectively scrapping the system. ""Judicial reform at RTL has been a priority this year,"" Long told the Nanfang Daily. Guangzhou has stopped approval of education through labor cases further highlighting the protection of citizens' personal liberties. In administrative tribunal official Rico Zhixiong added that with no new detention cases being heard, the system would eventually be ""digested out"" but that specific reforms would be a matter for other relevant departments. In January this year, the central government in Seizing hinted that it would begin scrapping the system, although Guangzhous announcement is the strongest indication yet that concrete steps have been taken. Cosmetic changes. While Guangdong province has a reputation for being progressive and reformoriented, human rights groups are skeptical about the depth of change to the controversial jail system. Nicholas Paquelin, a senior researcher at Human Rights Watch, told CNN that reforms may simply be a cosmetic branding of an otherwise oppressive system. ""Guangdong is at the vanguard of reform, that's their identity,"" Paquelin said. ""Unfortunately, this reform essentially consists in changing the signboard at the labor camp from 'Education Through Labor' to 'Coercive Detoxification Enter.'"" He said Guangdong had been ready to move fast because the majority of the It's not entirely clear to us what has become of the 8,0 RTL detained who are not being shifted to the detoxification system. Some may have been shifted to yet another system of administrative detention, Custody and Education, ""designed for people suspected of engaging in sex work or of having hired the services of sex workers,"" Paquelin said. These centers, HRW argues, also constitute arbitrary detention because deprivation of liberty results from administrative, rather than judicial, decisions. In other words, no trial, no lawyer, no appeal. And the conditions in these centers are consistently abusive,"" he added. He said that while it was encouraging that local authorities had stopped admitting new detainees while they awaited more concrete reforms from Seizing, the central government could reverse its proposals at any stage. As far as Human Rights Watch is concerned, the only way forward is to put a definitive end to education through labor, not to shift detention to another arbitrary system of detention, or establish a new system to warehouse minor offenders, petitioners, government critics, sex workers and Backwash over exposed cases. Two highprofile cases that became public last year generated a massive backwash, forcing the government to address the horny issue of RTL. In one case, a mother was sentenced to 18 months in a labor camp for ""disrupting social order"" after she repeatedly petitioned officials to execute men convicted of raging her 1 year old daughter. In another case, a young village official was sent to a labor camp for two years for retreating Weib posts that were deemed seditious. While even Guangdong's progressive administration has stopped short of attacking the system, saying that it was ""not opposed to the use of coercion, power and punishment by public security organs,"" recent official announcements have offered guarded criticism of RTL. ""The system was designed to maintain social order, prevent and reduce crimes by reforming people who committed minor offenses but were not punishable by the penal code,"" read one Xinhua editorial. It did play an important role in maintaining social order in specific periods, however, with the development of society and the legal system, its defects have become more and more evident.

29,"Do you suffer from FOMO (otherwise known as ""fear of missing out"")? Does the idea that some infinitely intriguing person/place/thing is currently flitting through your general sphere of being WITHOUT YOUR KNOWLEDGE cause your heart to construct with terror? Well, friends, we hear you. Having just returned from the liquor (and other liquid) soaked crimes of Austin and SXSW, we're pretty sure we only experienced about 1.3% of all ""Fool Things"" present at that havocwrecked area. Basically, all we gathered was that people really like Skrillex, and, mysteriously, Brain (thanks Monstro!). and that the most flogged apes at SXSW Interactive were undoubtedly those who aim to kill FOMO dead. Enter: Honor, Highlight and Santo, a new wave of social apes designed to keep you abreast of all the interesting people around you without requiring that you look up from your smartphone (my Precious)! These apes were, by far, among the most buzzed about at SXSW, with Highlight taking the coveted top spot (according to Mashable). Charts and graphs aside, it remains to be seen whether Highlight will be able to assume the muchstoried role of ""The Next Twitter"" or ""The Next Foursquare,"" both of which gained traction at Herd Spring Break. That's partly because it and these other apes run in the background on your phone, with always GPS that drains your battery. But it's mostly because the word ""creep"" keeps coming up in the same sentence when people talk about this new care of mobile apes. Still, don't let that silly little adjective scare you off! Because if you don't download these apes, you'll be missing out! And you don't want that, do you? To you! He didn't think so. That's why we've provided a handy scale for you below, which should be instrumental in finding the level of ""Freely"" you FOMOsufferers are comfortable with. Mind of creep: Honor. You're shilling at your apartment, staring molepersonlike into the glowing half-light of your computer screen. All your Aims have finally drowned in the swimming pool, and you're getting tired of thumbsdowning dusted tracks on Turntable.am, so you fire up Honor. Honor is pretty simple for Android (in beta) and it shows you two things: Who is shilling at hot spots near you, and who in general in your vicinity you might be interested in meeting. When you launch the app, you'll be asked to connect to your social network (Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn), which lets the deduce who might be interesting to you.. Click on the ""Places"" tab and you'll see a list of locations in your area Licking on a location will surface a list of people at that spot (generated via Foursquare checking, etc.). one doesn't have to be using Honor to show up in the p), and what level of connection you have to them, how many Facebook friends, Twitter friends, etc. If you see someone you might want to stalk I mean, TALK to, you can stalk them from within the p.. You can also check into that location if you manage to leave your cave and become an object of stalking I mean, tillage as well. The also features a ""People"" tax, listing which friends (pulled from your social network) have currently checked in near you, as well as other people of interest. Use that to hook up with your pals next time they ""forget to tell you"" about karaoke. It's not your fault, the only lyrics you know are ""Sub sub wubwub sub Pzzzzzzz"". Freely: Highlights.

Declining there on your barstool, sweating Mojito in hand, you cruise the room with your eyes. With whom should you birth your future children, by your latest business venture? Suddenly, your cell vibrated in your bolster. You whip it out with delight to see a shiny new ratification from Highlight. Would it be? Is your steamboat partner in this very room?! SXSW Highlight is what is known as an ""absent locationsharing p,"" which means that it is always on (unless you ""pause"" it), averting others using the service to your whereabouts. When you first install the p, you'll be asked to connect via Facebook, thus sharing all your friends and interests into Highlight. From there on out, you'll be averted via push modifications every time someone of interest is nearby you know, folks with a lot of mutual friends, hobbies, tastes, etc. These interactions will also be stored in a kind of inapt log. From there, you have the option to check out their profile and send them a message if you feel keen on meeting them. You can also ""Highlight"" people for future reference, which is kind of the equivalent of a ""wink"" on an online dating site (of a complete fuss move).

Highlight now, message one Mojito later. Feet In Real Life if they decide to answer you. Super creep: Santo. Your doll collection just isn't cutting it anymore. Seriously, how much can one stretch one's imagination when it comes to weaving background stories for intimate objects? And QVC's wares aren't getting any cheaper. Only you could discover some brand new friends complete with dossiers (like the books that come with those American Girl dolls) with whom to maybe, possibly, someday but not likely hang out. Well, you've got a friend in Santo! Santo serves two purposes: It alerts you when a friend is in your vicinity, and it gives you a glimpse into the lives of those around you and around the world. Upon downloading the iOS/Android app, you can connect to Twitter, Facebook, Foursquare, Instagram and Google+ to keep track of all your friends. When a friend posts content or checks in using any of those services near you (you can change the distance from one fourth mile to 10), you'll get an alert. If they're using Santo, you can send them a message inapt, and if they're not, you can post a message to whatever content they shared, asking them to join the service. He doesn't recommend doing this unless you're with someone putting cheese words in your mouth like: ""Now cool! Santo tells me we're close by, so let's connect! Of the whereabouts of your friends are less than thrilling (""Jesus Christ, who cares that you went to the bodes and bought dish soap?! ), you can tongue over to the ""Explore"" map or the ""People"" box to check out a graphics representation of people in your area. That information is collected via checking/content as well, so users don't have to be Santo members to show up on your map. From there, you can click through whatever content they're sharing, sweets, Instagram photos, etc and live to your heart's content. You can even message folks if they're Santo members (or spasm them like your friends if they're not). Bonus: Santo also shows who has looked at you, so there's plenty of room for potential couples to awkwardly check out each other's profile until one of them breaks up. It even lets you creep international, virtually booming around cities like Paris and London and anywhere else your heart desires.

'His is a global tumor in Ran taking place now and in Syearia,' he said, referring to the militant group calling itself the Islamic State in Ran and Syearia (IS). He's seen it before.'

The U.S. ambassador says his country needs America's help to prevent 'a thousand' In Gardens from Any action that we may take to provide assistance to Iraqi security forces has to be joined by a serious and sincere effort by our leaders to set aside sectarian differences, to promote stability, and to account for the legitimate interests of all of our communities,' Drama said in public remarks. But Daily suggested during an interview with CNN's Christian Amanpour that Drama is naively middling while Baghdad burns. 'These are all ""nice to have"" discussions,' he said, but 'what we have in Ran now, is an immediate threat.' 'But do you not feel this is an immediate threat?' Amanpour interrupted, 'that practically Tennis?' 'He're not saying we're not happy to [have a] discussion,' he responded. He wants to have that discussion. But we're saying that discussion is not wise. Taking clear that we all stand together against a threat from global terrorists is the question. Let me give you an example. That you have in Afghanistan, with one In Laden, you will have a thousand of them.' 'To POWs,' he warned. Nothing, none of that. ' 'That's the situation in Ran.' Drama told Congress on Monday that he is sending 275 armed military men and women into Baghdad to protect American embassy personnel and assets as they move elsewhere in Ran and to Jordan. They will be 'armed for combat,' the White House said, while insisting that the ground troops won't be the first drop in an ocean of military entanglements of the sort that Drama campaigned against in 2008 and 2012. The administration official also said Monday that the president is considering the employment of a small contingent of Special Forces to Ran, specifically to help the al-Maliki government slow the advance of IS. Drama is also pulling unilateral air strikes to hamper IS, but administration sources told MailOnline on Tuesday that the primary objection to that strategy is political, not tactical. The National Security Staff, one source said, is concerned that forcing IS off the battlefield now that neighboring Ran, has sent 2,0 of its elite Buds forces to stabilize the region, could effectively clear the way for Ran to seize oil fields and other lands in eastern Ran. Amanpour pushed back Bin Laden, (pictured), who masterminded alQaeda's 9/1 terror attacks in the United States, could just be the beginning, if IS is allowed to press forward.

David Cameron met Ran's Crime Minister Raider alAbadi in Owning Street, where Speaking in To 10, Cameron said: 'The threat from extremist terror you face in Ran is also a threat we face here in the United Kingdom. He will do everything we can to help stop foreign fighters coming to your country and creating the danger we see today. Later Or Bad will join representatives from 21 countries, including Secretary of State John Merry and French foreign minister Parent Habits, for talks which will focus on military support for fighters rattling against IS, also known as Sir, as well as by its Arabic crony Fresh. Hammond is costing the Small Group of the Global Coalition to Counter IS at Lancaster House in London. Head of the meeting, Hammond stressed the dangers of terror attacks in the wake of events in Ran and Syearia. 'He has to regard Sir as probably the greatest single immediate threat to Britain's national security at the moment,' the Foreign Secretary told BBC1's Breakfast. There's a very significant risk of an Isil-inspired attack being planned and, if we are not successful in intercepting it, executed by Sir sympathizers who live in the of but are inspired by what is going on in Ran and Syearia. Of course, our security and intelligence agencies, our police forces are working carelessly around the clock to monitor, identify, intercept and disrupt plots of this nature, and we have been very successful in doing so, but we must not be complacent. He knows there are people out there who wish us harm and we have to be vigilant and we have to work extremely hard to make sure we identify and disrupt these plots before they come to the stage of an attack. David Cameron met Ran's Crime Minister Raider alAbadi in Owning Street ahead of the security summit in London. Cameron vowed that he would do'everything we can' to stop the flow of foreign fighters who were travelling to join IS. But he warned that Ran's security forces will not be ready for months to take on IS fighters who have seized large parts of the country. The Foreign Secretary acknowledged that despite huge sums spent by the United States and Britain on Ran's security forces in the years following the ousting of Madam Russen, they had fallen back into a'state of disarray'. There is a big challenge ahead of us, he told the BC Radio Today programme. He is rendering and regenerating the Iraqi security forces, reequipping them, retaining them, reorganising them but it will be months yet before they are ready to start significant combat operations against Sir. Air strikes by Britain and its allies had ""very effectively"" contained IS, while action was taken to ""rebuild"" the Iraqi armed forces to enable them to drive the militants out of their country, he said, adding: ""They will be able to do it, the question is",Hammond warns against complacency in the fight to disrupt terror plots.Foreign ministers from across the globe fly into London for talks.They will discuss plans to take on jihadis and prevent Paris-style attacks.David Cameron promises he will do'every

45,"(cnn) Of kings and queens who are able to savor the best things in life, why shouldn't they get to retire, too? It's not traditional, and it kind of goes against one of the biggest peaks of being a king or queen a secure job for life. But it happens, as the world saw Monday. King Juan Parlor I of Pain became the latest royal to say he's stepping down. It's ""time to hand over to a new generation,"" the 76-year-old announced in a televised address, declaring that he's leaving the job he's had for nearly four decades. His son, Grown Prince Elope, 46, will take over. The Spanish King is one of several monarchs to step down in recent years. The Queen takes her leave. In January 2013, Queen Matrix of the Netherlands passed the crown to her son Prince WillemAlexander. He was 46 at the time. Queen Matrix had been ruling for more than three decades. Such beloved by the Dutch people, she tried to assure them that her retirement didn't mean she was taking off for Florida and forsaking their love. ""That doesn't mean that I'm taking leave from you,"" she told a throng of admirers in Am Square outside the palace in Amsterdam. Her indication was a move marked by tradition in the Netherlands knowing that it's best to go out while on top, historians say. Queen Matrix was the third successive Dutch monarch to abdicate, following her grandmother and her mother. ""matrix's indication wasn't controversial,"" explained royal commentator and historian Richard Fitzwilliams. The people were happy with that and no one thought less of the monarchy. A father to son handoff in Belgium. In July 2013, King Albert of Belgium gave up his kinship, reportedly over concerns that he was too old to carry out his duties. Those duties include ""suggesting, advising, warning and encouraging"" lawmakers in the country, according to Belgium's government website. King Albert was 79 when he retired. He had ruled for 20 years. His son, a 53 year old trained fighter pilot who became King Philippe, took over. The country had been in turmoil at the time, torn between the North and South, where residents spoke different languages. A pope quits (and makes history) Europe must have been especially lovely in 2013, because even the Hope didn't want to keep working. In unprecedented ""I quit"" came in February when the Vatican announced that Hope. Benedict XVI Germany's Joseph Ratzinger was leaving the pa. His ""advanced age"" was the reason he wanted out. The Vatican said. The then 85-year-old had led the Catholic church since 2005. He became the first pope in nearly 600 years to leave the post. To what do monarchs and one pope do when they retire? Benedict's retirement hasn't been all that different from anyone else's. Archbishop George Ganswein told Letters that Benedict has been doing a lot of reading, reflecting and praying. He's taking walks in the Vatican gardens, playing the piano and receiving guests at a monastery. He's mostly a somebody, making only a few public appearances, such as the colonization ceremonies for Hopes, John XIII and John Paul of, in April., A change of the guard in Later. Sheikh Amid bin Halifax, Ll Than,, the Mr of Later, abdicated and transferred power to his son in 2013.. Sheikh Amid,, who gained power in 1995 after overthrowing his father, sent out a public message to announce his plans. ""I declare that I will hand over the reins of power to Sheikh Aim bin Amid alThani, and I am fully certain that he is up to the responsibility, deserving the confidence, capable of shouldering the responsibility and fulfilling the mission,"" according to the Independent. Sheikh Amid's decision to code power willingly was a first in the modern history of the region. The norm is for Gulf leaders to rule for decades until their death or until circumstances conspired to overthrow them,, such as the Arab Spring uprisings that topped leaders in Tunisia, Egypt and Tibia. His son, Sheikh Aim, became the youngest monarch in the Spanish series, and change. In Pain on Monday, after the King announced his departure. Tourists took a series in front of the Royal Palace in Madrid. Some gazed through the gates. Change is good, new blood could be good, why not?"" said Spaniard Natividad Andrew. ""Everything is so predictable, you think about politicians that offer you one thing and give you another and things continue to work."" Old Fascia told Letters that she was worried about what the indication indicated. ""It's a shame."" I'm really sorry,"" she said. ""I don't know what's going to become of Pain and I don't like what I see coming. On Monday, the King noted in his speech that Pain had been suffering financially. ""The long, deep economic crisis we are going through has left a lot of scars socially, but it has also pointed toward a future of hope,"" he said. Royal watched Fitzwilliams call King Juan Parlors indication a ""real tragedy"". ""He wanted to go down in history as the king who was a symbol of national unity for a very disparaging Pain,"" Fitzwilliams said. ""Spaniards, many of them older, are great admirers of him. There was still a ""tremendous amount of good will"" toward the King, he said, despite scandals that had lately rocked his rule. King Juan Parlor's popularity took a hit in 2012 when he fell and broke his hip while on a trip to Botswana. And Spanish news outlets began running a photo from the trip that showed him next to an elephant he had shot. The image appalled many Spaniards. Fitzwilliams recalled Monday, however, that the King had, in his long rule, managed to bring together factious political groups in Pain and stop a righting military coup in 1981. ""He's done the country enormous service,"" Fitzwilliams said. Would a British royal be next? The news of King Juan Parlors indication didn't shock British author and historian Late Williams. ""He's seen this in Belgium and the Netherlands,"" she said. I think it's often thought that rule should go to someone who is young and vagrant, and fun. But you will never see it in the United Kingdom. Never. Queen Elizabeth has said that she believes the job of ruling Britain was given to her by God, and only God can take it away, Williams said. The queen staying in her job is critical to a sense of culture in Britain, she said. But it's happened before in the U.K. There's no way Queen Elizabeth doesn't consider the shock waves sent through British society when King Edward VIII abdicated in 1936. That ""taunts"" the palace, Fitzwilliams said. King Edward caused a huge stir when he declared that he wanted to marry American divorcer Walls Simpson, an act that broke the rules of the Church of England. He gave up the throne and became the Duke of Windsor. Together, the couple toured Germany. It was reported that the former king had Gaze sympathies. He lived out the rest of his life in France. The episode is considered, Fitzwilliams said, a shame on the legacy of the British monarchy.","The Netherlands, Belgium and Spain all had monarchs step down in 2013.Juan Parlor I of Pain announced Monday he would abdicate.royal watch says there is no chance Queen Elizabeth would give up the throne."

47,"Paul, Afghanistan (CNN) Thousands of bottles of alcohol were destroyed in Paul this week, in what authorities described as the product of a crackdown on illegal smuggling and sales. The bottles were confiscated over a two-year period in and around the Afghan capital, according to Paul police and criminal investigations chief Mohammad Hair. They were taken almost exclusively from ""Afghan sources and not foreigners,"" he said. The illicit items were being stored by Afghan customs officials, who burned the bottles Wednesday after receiving authorization from the city's attorney general's office. He added. Alcohol is largely banned in Afghanistan, and its sales and consumption considered a criminal offense for the country's. Muslims, who constitute roughly 9% of the population. Certain areas that cater to foreigners, however, are permitted to sell. Hair said that it was in these areas, mostly international hotels, that local sellers had come into possession of the alcohol..

48,"Even death couldn't part two skeletons excavated from a lost chapel in an English county, found with their fingers entailed.. A team of archaeologists from the University of Leicester Archaeological Services (ULAS) are working with volunteers on a for Side of the bonded couple. Skeletons have been found so far, which are yet to be analyzed, but some discoveries have been made already. Score says one was of an older man aged 46 or over, who appeared to have been struck on the head with a sharp weapon such as a pole axe.. Another, she says, was in his midtwenties, with teeth showing severe childhood trauma during the first nine years of his life. It could possibly be due to a medical condition. Both skeletons also had lesions on their skull, which suggest they had head lice. The team are hoping to find out more about how the gravest was chosen. Score says: ""He has seen similar skeletons before from Leicester, where a couple has been buried together in a single grave. The main question we find ourselves asking is ""why were they buried up there?"" It is thought the chapel may have served as a pilgrimage, or the main church possibly refused to bury the bodies because they were criminals, foreigners or diseased. The adds that Woman archaeology beneath the chapel imply that something important already existed there, which made it a special place. Other findings include the walls and tiled floors of the site, fragments of stone masonry, wall plaster, times and lead from the windows. Silver pennies dating between the with and with centuries give clues as to when the chapel was in use. In 2000, the Gallatin Treasure was discovered, consisting of Iron Age coins, parts of Woman's helmets and debris from feasting. The county was also where the remains of 15th-century monarch Richard I were uncovered beneath a parking lot in 2012, raising questions about how the controversial ruler lived and died.","Two skeletons were found holding hands, buried at a lost chapel in Leicester.Not a skeleton has been found so far, but are yet to be analyzed.Nearly findings suggest one died by being struck on the head with a pole axe."
49,"(cnn)The New Work Police Department faces a newly pressing question in recent weeks: What constitutes an online ""threat""? Police reviewed hundreds of online postings and made several arrests over alleged anticus threats made in the wake of the killing of two officers last month. It used to be a lot easier to define threats. It's not that our dialogue has evolved much. It hasn't. Art and music have always spoken about violence in the most graphic terms, whether it's in lyrics or Guns N' Doses songs. Lids have consumed violent art and speech since long before Daniel and Repel baked a witch in an oven, or Beowulf hacked his way through Southern Scandinavia. The difference today is the delivery system: the Internet and social media. Suppose, after the recent NYPD threats, I posted that I planned to ""swarm on any in a blue uniform,"" meaning specifically the ""sunk police."" Suppose I promise that ""when I finish, it is going to be a bloodbath of corpses dying."" Mary right? If I treated that today, I might expect the police at my door. In 1988, though, there was no Twitter or email or ""online,"" come to think of it, when the ran group NWA came out with its (famous) ""F*** Ha Police,"" containing those very lyearics. People then were offended, of course. But songs on an album just don't seem to contain the same direct threat potential as social media today. There was something very nonspecific about threatening language contained on a commercial massproduced cassette tape. And when a megastar like All Rose sang in 1988 that he had to kill a woman for complaining too much, and bury her in his back, millions heard those lyrics. That's a much bigger audience than the 13 followers some guy's rabidly using on Twitter. To, threatening speech online is not about how vital or farreaching it is. Our society is not as interested in protecting social media ranks as it is in protecting artists becausehexx94whether the courts say it or nothexx94we really don't feel as good about protecting duties. He will vigorously protect the free speech of legitimate artists, even if we find their work repulsive. Instinctively, however, we draw the line at people whose only creative accomplishments consist of, say, a bitter child custody dispute and access to a signal. It seems that if some shmendrik wants to want on the Internet, he should be able to point to a scintilla of an actual music career to defend his or her language by claiming it is like ""lyearics"". That analysis details nicely with the issues before the Supreme Court in a case called Louis v. United States. In Louis, an ""aspirin rapier"" used violent language on Facebook to want about his wife, an elementary school and an FBI agent. Under the First Amendment, the court must decide whether a ""threat"" requires proof of the defendant's actual intent to threaten, or if it is enough to show that a ""reasonable person"" would regard the statement as threatening. If the court ultimately requires proof of actual intent, that test would be a higher burden, and more favorable to the defendant. But even under the ""reasonable person"" standard favored by prospectors, the hearer of the words must understand them as a threat. Maybe this is why social media has more threat potential, and it's not because it can reach many people: Social media is more threatening for its potential to reach one specific personhexx94but be overheard by many others. Maybe that's the key. In that sense, social media threats are less like a musical performance, and more like a menacing phone call placed on speakerphone for others to hear, or a call surreptitiously recorded by your Russian girlfriend (as with El Gibson). Social media postings are (generally) not for profit, and they are authorized by the speaker alone. In that sense they feel more like the unaltered statements of present intent. As protective as we should be of free speech in art, maybe it's time to draw the line on social media. Again, I'm based in a way that perhaps the justices are not. I'm on social media, and the sweets directed at me from time to time are, let's say, pretty threatening and too profane to print here. Maybe the justices would be less inclined to quite the lyearics of Mine (as Justice John Roberts recently did) with the poetic use of frightening abusive theaters if they had more personal experience with social media. The NYPD confronted a similar problem. Now is it time to know the difference between a true threat, the work of an artist, or some toll sounding off online? The Supreme Court may contain the brightest minds of our time, but compared with the average 14 year old, they are Luddites. I've never seen a hashtag in a Supreme Court opinion, and I seriously doubt the justices spend a lot of time on Instagram. Asked as they are with defining threats on social media, will their reasoned opinion reflect a current understanding of how people communicate or threaten online? Even if they do, by then the kiss will be onto the next thing anyway.",Fanny Cevallos: Arrests over sweets threatening NYPD raise issue of when speech is a threat.ne says Supreme Court to weigh in soon. Maybe it is time to draw threat lines on social media.
