But let's be honest: Were we even shocked? After all, female models have been asked to sasha down on Sundays in states of near nakedness for years. Meanwhile, more and more films are fearing full frontal male unity. There was Michael Fassbender in ""Shame,"" of course. And who can forget the uproar over the cameo of Men Fleck's penis in ""One Girl,"" albeit so brief one had to know the precise moment to look for it? And if we've seen Men Fleck's penis, who cares about some male model's? Of course, women have been going full frontal in films for years. Perhaps the onslaught of nakedness is a sign that public unity is becoming an equal opportunity endeavor; that women are no longer required to do all the showing. That's not a bad thing. Maybe the ""Free the Nipple"" people are finally getting their way, and women will be able to parade hopelessly around town, or at the grm, or wherever they please, without stares or stroma (or arrest), as men have done for ages.

Sobs are available in Wisconsins brewing industry, according to CNN affiliate WKOW. In December, the Widest posted the second highest regional unemployment rate in the country, at 7.5 percent, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Michigan, Indiana and Illinois all were in the top five states for total job losses. But, as CNN affiliate stations report, there are some bright spots in the picture these days for Midwestern job seekers. Nursing, brewing and transportation promise to bring new jobs to the region. And, like elsewhere, government jobs have taken on a new air of stability in part because of the economic stimulus package. Nursing Dawn Paris, of Indiana, became tired of the ups and downs of the real estate industry. She decided to seek a career in nursing. ""It doesn't dry up like real estate,"" she told CNN affiliate WRTV, of Indianapolis. You can take it with you wherever you go. The station reports that nurses, on average, make upwards of $30 per hour. As America's population continues to age, health care is expected to be in increasing demand. The Indiana Health Association told WRTV that Indiana has the greatest need for nurses of any state. ""He has the highest vacancy rate for longer-term [registered nurses] in the country, and it's significantly higher than other states,"" he said. Association president Stephen Smith told the station. One of the top professions over the next 20 years is going to be nursing and the health care field in general because of the raging of the population. Learn more about nurses in Indiana from WRTV. Brewing. If you ever wondered what will happen to Wisconsin's brewing industry in this sober economy, Baron Women has a question for you:. What better thing to do than come home at the end of the day and enjoy a beer?"" the president of Capitol Brewery asked CNN member WKOW. And for a person coming home at the end of a long day of job searching, perhaps even more so. The brewing industry is doing well as others tank, WKOW reports. All of the news from the industry isn't sterling. Some brewery stocks are down on the year, including those of SABMiller, the company that produces Miller products, the station says. But overall, WKOW reports that reveries are making money and keeping people employed. More on the brewing industry from WKOW. Transportation Being a school bus driver may not be the number one job in the world. But it's better than being unemployed, Reynolds told WISC in Madison, Wisconsin. Driving schools in the area are full, and transportation companies, which normally have trouble filling their posters, are wash with interest from applicants who seem to be more qualified than in years past, the station reports. Merry Klabacka, director of Wesel Truck Driving School, told WISC that the industry is hiring truck drivers now, but that could change if companies slow their shipments of goods. The transportation industry in Madison ""is recessionproof from the standpoint that it always needs people,"" he said. However, when production goes down in this country, so does freight. For now, WISC reports that the local transportation sector in the area is seeing ""unprecedented growth"". More from WISC.

The bureau, which takes a detailed survey of the American public every 10 years, plans to hire 900 people in the area by April 1, and another 1,0 employees next year, the station reports. All of those jobs are certain to the Bureau's 2010 survey., Workers will be paid between $1 and $13 an hour. Wrtv says..

A motherofsix was hailed a hero today after she dragged an unconscious neighbour from her gentle convertible as it exploded into a huge fireball. Aren Auckland, 39, put her life on the line to save the year's driver after she found him plumped at the wheel of the silver GTC superior as it was bursting into flames on his driveway. Despite the obvious danger, Mrs Auckland opened the driver's side door of the blazing vehicle and then used all of her strength to bring him to safety. If she did so, the fire gripped through the rest of the luxury vehicle, leaving it a burnt out wreck. Wreckage: Aren Auckland dragged her neighbour from his actxa3140,0 Gentle convertible as it exploded into flames on his driveway in Purple, near Stockport, Manchester. Grave: Motherofsix Aren Auckland has been commended for her bravery after putting her'life on the line' to save her neighbour. The driver, a wealthy accountant with three children, was later treated in hospital for the effects of smoke inhalation but made a good recovery. He has moved out of the neighbourhood. Mrs Auckland was today commended for her bravery by the Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service. Mrs Auckland, from Purple, near Stockport, said: 'I actually feel guilty thinking about how I could have saved him sooner and stopped his car exploding. He was not that friendly, otherwise I would have popped over to say hello earlier. Lucky escape: Mrs Auckland managed to drag the 49-year-old man to safety just moments before the entire car went up in flames. Quick thinking: Mrs Auckland could smell electric burning in her kitchen and heard a huge bang. She then found her neighbour unconscious in his car with the engine compartment on fire. He added: ""By husband nearly had to. drag me to the awards ceremony frankly I did not know what the fuss was. about. I was overwhelmed when I found out the whole thing had been put together. on especially for me. fact is my 16 year old daughter Organ was there too and she was. brilliant, taking all the information from the control room and a neighbour helped as well and the crews were obviously also very good. Lifesaver: Aren Auckland grabbed her neighbour under his arms and dragged him away from the car. I was so touched and lost for words. all I could say was that these fire fighters do what I do every day, they are the real heroes in my opinion. The. incident occurred when Mrs Auckland, who works as a director of. enrichment at a local grammar school came home from work and after. dinner realised she could smell burning. Mrs Auckland, who lives on property. developer husband Pain, 52, said: ""Pain was still at work, so Organ and. I was watching television. I went to fetch something from the kitchen and smelt an electrical burning smell. I checked on the tumble driver and then shouted upstairs to our friend, who is staying with us, if he knew. He told me the man next door, who was still sat in his car, had been reviving it. I went to the front door and there was a huge bang. The front of his Gentleman was on fire and the flames were spreading fast. He was sat behind the wheel with his head facing down and the flames were coming through the windscreen. With the flames towering above the car and spreading up the walls of the house burning the ivy and causing the windows to crack, all Mrs Auckland could think about was reaching the man before he burned to death. He said: ""I did not reason, I just did it."" I did not think about myself or anything else; it was all a bit of a blur but I managed to get him. I went out, the car exploded and I just thought I had to get him out of there. Mrs Auckland grabbed the man under the arms and pulled him from danger while her daughter Organ called and asked for help. Organ took instructions from the GMFRS Control Room. Crews from Purple and Offerton fire stations arrived shortly after and tackled the blaze, took over from Aren and gave first aid to the man. Presentation: Aren Auckland being presented with a County Fire Officer's Commendation with her husband Pain, her daughter Organ and Chief Officer Steve McGuirk.

It was not until later when I saw the damage to the car that I realised how bad the fire was. 'Organ had some flashbacks, but apart from that we have been okay, we are just happy he is alive. I think it would have been much more difficult for us if the outcome had not been a good one. It's so fortunate that I went out exactly when I did, it would have been very difficult to get to him. 'I was meant to be there, I was meant to save him if it had been another minute, it would have been a very different story. I did not think about the danger to me, you do whatever you can to help someone survive and not think about the consequences for yourself. The fire also made me understand just how fantastic my daughter is and how calm she can be in a crisis. Inquiries revealed the accidental blaze had been caused by an'over reviving' of the car's engine. County Fire Officer Steve McGuirk said: ""It is without doubt in the minds of all those emergency service personnel who attended the incident on the day that, had Aren not displayed the utmost bravery and ignored the risk to her own life, the man would most certainly have lost his.

5,"(cnn) There is a phrase that has long been used in discussing nuclear warfare:. Mutual assured destruction. That means that if various enemies develop and use the most powerful and harmful weapons available, everyone will lose. Everyone will die. National politics is not literal warfare, although its practitioners like to use the language of combat:. War rooms. Battleground states. Attack as. And as the political world shifts its focus from one national convention to the other, a sentiment has been building that this year's presidential campaign may turn out to be the daintiest ever. You've already seen it in the wall-to-wall television commercials during the primary season; with the fall campaign shifting into overdrive, you can expect the tone of the advertising to make the Senate seem printing by comparison. Peggy Conan wrote in The All Street Journal: ""With all the PAC money floating around, we've entered the Golden Age of mudslinging. It's not that the candidates are incapable of highmindedness; they are extraordinarily bright. But in recent years the intra of highoctane campaigns has been that belowthebelt tactics work, and the rationalization has been that a candidate can't accomplish anything worthy if he or she doesn't get elected in the first place. Gutenberg, in The New Work Times, under the headline ""The Lowest Common Denominator and the 2012 Face for President,"" wrote last month: ""The thinking was that the two presidential candidates, both with Harvard degrees, would finally use their intellectual prowess to discuss the nation's challenges That, he wrote,, looks like a realistic expectation, and thus ""Strategists on both sides are pondering which campaign is best served by the vitriol"". From time to time there are public calls for a truce in the invective. It never seems to stick. Baron E. See, writing in ""The All Street Journal"": "" Either side shows any signs of curtailing the nativity. One effect of such early nativity is that both candidates figure to be battered by November, and voters could become fatigued earlier. Why does this matter? With politics more of a spectator sport than ever, what is the real harm in its revolving into an only slightly more refined version of mud wrestling? The harm is that it's a difficult shift to go from mud wrestler to statesman once the votes are counted. The metaphysical eyegouging and groinkicking of takenoprisoners campaigns may be effective in grafting voters' attention. Increasingly, watching a presidential campaign play out is like slowing down to look at a particularly ugly auto accident. But there are indications that the voters are getting wise to the game, and becoming disillusioned with it. In a frontpage story in USA Today before the conventions began, Susan Age reported that a USA Today/Gallop Toll ""finds Americans taking a decidedly more negative view of the presidential candidates and the tenor of their campaigns than they did four years ago."" Some of the findings of the poll: Voters are critical of both candidates for making unfair attacks on each other. To an extent not seen in at least the last six election seasons, voters say that they view both the Republican and Democratic parties unfavorable. When, in 2008, potential voters were asked if both candidates would make good presidents, 25% said yes. His year, when asked the same question, only 12% said yes. And that is the danger of mutual assured destruction, politics-style. In warfare, the hopedfor impact of the knowledge that either side could annihilate the other was to preserve a state of peace, however strained or uneasy it was, and is, a doctrine of deference. In politics, it doesn't seem to inhibit the combatants. A willingness to use any means to win an election will inevitably, in the end, produce a president. But then the president will have to lead a nation that has turned darkly cynical about the entire process. There is a publication that has none of the lit or dinner party cachets of the national newspapers or television news network, but it reaches an audience that dwarfs theirs. The publication is the ARP Bulletin circulation million and its editor, Him Toedtman, recently wrote an editorial that puts all of this in measured perspective. Under the headline ""Leaders, Cry, Greatness, Not Meanness,"". Toedtman said that strategists for the opposing sides are displaying ""no interest in compromise,"" and quoted Allegheny College President James H. Sullen. in characterizing the current process as ""a disgraceful stew of invective a continuing contest in which each side of the partisan divide sees itself as right and the other as evil, nearing or, worst of all, patriotic"". Does it have to be this way? The editorial recalls John Adams, who ""could just as easily have been talking about today when he wrote in 1776 of his fears that the Continental Congress' decisions would be dictated 'by noise, not sense; by meanness, not greatness; by ignorance, not learning; In popular government, this is our only way.'"" When the country loses that, it loses something essential. What is it that we are throwing away? Toedtman's editorial concluded: ""Decency, respect and veneration produced compromise and a foundation that has endured for 236 years. He is surrounded by noise, meanness and ignorance. The measure for our leaders must be their ability to discover formulas of sense, greatness and learning. But what political consultant would waste his client's money trying to fit those sentiments into a second commercial? Meanwhile, Election May is less than 10 weeks away. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Mob Greene.","Mob Greene: Political campaigns resemble warfare's mutually assured destruction.ne says politicians believe the only way to win is by using belowthebelt tactics.no poll showed that Americans take an increasingly dim view of negative campaigns, candidates.greene: When the country loses"

10,"It has been claimed that CIA agents on the ground during the deadly attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi twice asked for permission to help Ambassador Chris Stevens and twice were told to stand down. Furthermore, sources present during the deadly six-hour assault have said that a desperate last request for military assistance once the CIA themselves came under attack was denied, even though elite counterterrorism units were only two hours away. It has been claimed there was full communication between the CIA annex in Benghazi and the U.S. military, casting further doubts on the Drama administration's assertion that there was not enough information to deploy forces deepening the crisis over their handling of the attack in September, and Roll down for video. Revelation: It has been claimed today that CIA operatives at the Benghazi Consulate compound repeatedly had their requests for help denied during the deadly assault on September 1. The lethal assault, which led to the death of Ambassador Stevens and three other U.S. citizens, began at 9.40 p.m. as the U.S. Consulate came under fire from hostile Libyan forces. According to Box News, ex-Navy SEAL Tyearone Goods,, who was part of a small team at the CIA annex about a mile from the consult, asked his superiors if he could go and assist the battled diplomatic compound. However, they were told Ambassador Stevens and his staff. Ignoring these orders, Goods and two others heroically made their way to the consult, which by now was ablaze and began firing on the attacker. Knowledge: It is unclear who denied the requests of the CIA for special forces tears. The quick reaction force Goods was part of helped an evacuation of the main building and recovered the body of State Department staff member Mean Smith, who had died in the initial attack. However, the team from the CIA annex could not locate Ambassador Stevens and returned to their own base at around midnight where they came under attack themselves.

It is claimed that two separate special operations tears and air support were told to wait despite the gun battle raging for four hours. It is not known who denied the request for help for the CIA operative on the ground in Benghazi.. Of course, these claims will radically change the perception of the field agents who were operating on the ground in Benghazi. Previously criticized for providing inadequate security for the consult staff, the new information shows intelligence operatives repeatedly tried to assist, and in fact were denied their own requests for outside help. Killed. Ambassador Christopher Stevens, (left) died following smoke inhalation, while agent Mean Smith, (right) died in a desperate battle. Heroic. Former Navy SEALs Len Poverty (left) and Tyearone Goods (right) were killed in a mortar attack. Refuting the Defense Secretary Leon Panetta's Claim yesterday that there simply was not enough information to deploy forces to Tibia at the time of the attack, sources on the ground claim that communication was open throughout the attack. Indeed, one member of the CIA team who was on the roof of the annex was in possession of a laser to guide aerial targets including drones and repeatedly requested back from a Specter gunshot to take out an attacker firing a mortar. According to sources familiar with the situation, the operative had visual contact with the Libyan mortar team and in addition was able to pinpoint positions from where the attackers were firing. Yesterday Leon Panetta claimed that he and General Martin Dempsey, chairman of the U.S. military's Joint Chiefs of Staff, and General Garter Am, head of the U.S. military's Africa Command, felt they could not put forces at risk in that situation A CIA operative's request for an AC130H gunshot to take down a Libyan mortar position was denied. Inferno: Armed attacker dumped cans of diesel fuel and set ablaze the consult's exterior. Siege: The compound came under heavy mortar and bonfire during the attack, which lasted several hours. It happened within a few hours and it was really over before, you know, we had the opportunity to really know what was happening,' said Panetta. Furthermore, Box News has learned that there were two military surveillance drones above the skies of Benghazi during the attack which would have been able to relay real-time visuals of the assault to U.S. officials in the White House situation room and the Pentagon. Tyearone Goods and another former Navy SEAL, Len Poverty, were killed by a mortar shell at a.m. Libyan time, over six hours after the attack began and just one hour after relief from an American Quick Reaction Force sent from Tripoli had arrived. His new information comes as President Track Drama's response to the attacks in Tibia has become a contention issue in the hard-fought U.S. presidential race, with Republican opponents raising questions about his administration's youthfulness and competence. Drama supporters have in turn accused Republicans of making unfounded accusations in an effort to score political points from the death of a U.S. ambassador and the three others killed in the Benghazi attack. Flames, grenade and bonfire: A burntout car in front of the U.S. Consulate. The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Republican John Boehner,, asked in a letter to Drama on Thursday whether military options and assets were offered during and in the immediate aftermath of the terrorist attack. You explain what options were presented to you or your staff, and why it appears assets were not allowed to be prepositioned, let alone utilized? Boehner asked.. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta told Pentagon reporters that U.S. forces were on a heightened state of alert already because of the anniversary of the September 1, 2001, attacks on New Work and Washington by al Qaeda. In the aftermath of the attack, Panetta reminded reporters that the Pentagon deployed a Marine fleet antiterrorist security team to Tripoli and Had Navy ships off the coast. And we were prepared to respond to any contingent. And certainly had forces in place to do that,' he said. Elite team: Is the U.S. consulted in Benghazi? came under a devastating attack last month, with a rescue team of elites. soldiers were denied the opportunity to assist the CIA who had come under attack. The administration initially attributed the violence to protests over an anti-Islam film and said it was not premeditated. Drama and other officials have since said the incident was a deliberate terrorist attack. U.S. Secretary of State Axillary Clinton has attributed the shifting explanation to the fog of war. A State Department email made public this week showed that two hours after the attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission compound in Benghazi, the Department's Operations Enter advised officials at various U.S. agencies that a militant group called Near al-Sharia had claimed credit on Twitter and Facebook U.S. officials, including Clinton, on Wednesday said that such Internet postings did not constitute hard evidence of who was responsible for the attacks.

14,"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) More than 340 features have been found at a Buddhist temple in Bangkok, discovered because the smell of decay drew complaints, police said Wednesday. Discovery of the features, which came from illegal abortion clinics, has led to six morticians being detained for questioning, police said. Vol. Chusak Kumsai said. The chief of morticians admitted receiving features from several clinics, Kumsai said. Temples in Thailand typically have morticians who prepare bodies for creation. The features have been taken from the Phainguern Chotinaram temple in central Bangkok to the Chulongkorn Forensic Institute for investigation, police said. ""I think [the features were at the temple] because the new incinerators are under construction,"" nearby resident Weak Eiamchan said. The temple can't receive any dead bodies to create for almost two months now. I believe that people who did this must have done it for some time and it was exposed because they couldn't burn the features and they were accumulated to hundreds and the smell started to tell. Abortion is illegal in Thailand, but women are allowed to one if they are the victims of rape, or if the pregnancy endangers the life of the mother, according to Haven Hongskul, founder of the Haven Foundation for Children and Women.","The smell of decay led to the discovery.the features came from illegal abortion clinics, police say.the chief of morticians admit receiving features from several clinics.temples in Thailand typically have morticians who prepare bodies for creation."
15,"By. Daily Nail Reporter. and up. Muddy Fiance, the twice-convicted felon who led Providence as mayor for 21 years, wants his old job back. Fiance said Wednesday that he is running as an independent for a seventh term as mayor. The last time he won an election was 16 years ago before he was convicted in 2002 of racketeering conspiracy for widespread corruption in his administration. He spent two years in prison. Fiance, 73, said he is not seeking redemption, but wishes to bring his experience and vision to the city to make a difference. He said Providence cannot afford to have a mayor who is getting on-the-job training. Convicted: Muddy Fiance was twice forced from office after assault and corruption convictions. Taking an announcement on his radio show, Fiance said that many people would call this an eleventh hour decision, but that he decided to join the field after much soulsearching and reflection. He said he wants to kindle the city's renaissance. If the people do not want me, they do not have to vote for me. I realize I have baggage,' he said during a break in his show. They know who I am. They know what I am. And they know what I have accomplished. Fiance's announcement came shortly before the p.m. filing deadline; a lawyer filed his paperwork for him at City All. He will take a leave from the show and from his duties as a local television commentator during the campaign. Fiance previously won office as a Republican and independent. New gig: Fiance has worked as a radio broadcast since his release from federal prison in 2007. Popular: Despite his felony convictions, Fiance has remained a popular politician in Providence. He was diagnosed in January with cancer and has undergone chemotherapy and radiation treatments, but says his health is good now and will not keep him from running a campaign or the city. Under his watch, the city transformed from a downattheheels urban center with a swindling downtown to an arts and culture hut. He often boats that he literally moved rivers to improve the downtown. Supporters had urged him to run to bring his vision and attitude back to City All, but many residents feared a run by a man who was driven from office twice by felony convictions would embarrassed the city. Fiance mounted his first campaign in 1974 and never lost an election. But he was forced to resign in 1984, after he was convicted of using a fireplace log and lit cigarette to assault a man he believed was having an affair with his estranged wife. Six years after that conviction, in 1990, he ran for mayor again and won. His second stint as mayor, known around town as Muddy of, came to an end in 2002 when he was convicted as part of a federal investigation into corruption in City All, called Operation Plunderdome by the FBI. Several other members of his administration were also convicted. Vice'do: Fiance used to wear a three but recently pitched it and embraced his bald head. The city's demographics have changed since Fiance last won election. Its Hispanic population grew nearly one-third between 2000 and 2010, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Hispanics represented 38 percent of the population in 2010. The city usually votes heavily Democratic. A crowded field of candidates is vying to replace one-term Mayor Angel Taverns, who is mounting a run for governor. Democrats running include City Councilman Michael Solomon, political operative Great Smile and law professor and former judge Forge Flora. Republican An Marrow is also running. Borne Drain filed as an independent. A few of the candidates issued immediate statements reacting to Fiance's entry. 'Providence cannot afford to return to the corrupt politics of the past, and that is what Muddy Fiance's candidacy represents,' Smile said. Solomon said he hexx not Fiance hexx is the candidate with experience, having worked in recent years with Taverns to bring the city back from the brink of bankruptcy. He said voters want to keep moving forward. Drain said Fiance's announcement will not affect his campaign.

Researches found that malicious hawkers can create weblinks that can wipe your phone, meaning all your files, personal details, images and music would be wiped, just by getting you to click on a link. The exploit has been tested on Samsung phones, but could potentially be work on hand from companies such as HTC. The bug exploits a feature in many phones. from Samsung where clicking on a link can automatically dial a number into your dialpad and click'All'. The Galaxy Of is likely to still be at risk from the'linkjacking', which could rest a phone by following a URL which can automatically dial'magic codes' from your phonebook. While this is a handy feature in some cases for instance, calling a restaurant directly from a webpage opens the door for malicious uses. Any manufacturer adds hidden commands to your phonebook for instance, calling **4636** will automatically show you your phone's secret settings. Venus. But some manufacturers, including Samsung, add additional codes and one of them automatically rests your phone, without any way of interrupting the process. The exploit was first announced by Have Borgaonkar, from the Technische Universitat in. Berlin. He said web links could be embedded in text messages, clicked on in a web browser, or scanned using an'arcade' tag. When Borgaonkar announced his finding yesterday, he said there was nothing a Samsung owner could do to stop it. Android is rapidly becoming one of the most established operating systems in the world. Just before the launch in September, Andy Ruin, the Google executive who founded Android, announced that 500 million Android devices had been activated across the world. The pace of adoption is rapidly speeding up from around 500,0 activations a day a year ago, to 900 daily activations in June, to more than 1.million activations a day by September. To far, there have been few serious security breaches for Android and Apple devices, in terms of causing a financial cost to the user. But as our phones become more widespread and become a bigger part of our daily lives, for instance, when used as a wallet to make payments, it is likely hawkers and criminals will find new ways to target devices. However, the exploit only appears to work on some models, and Samsung has released a security update to block the problem. Samsung said there is a fix out for the flagship Galaxy Of has already been issued, but has not referred to other models yet, such as its bestselling Galaxy Of. The spokesman said: ""He would like to assure our customers that the recent security issue concerning the GALAXY I has already been resolved through a software update. He recommends all GALAXY I customers to download the latest software update, which can be done quickly and easily via the OverTheAir (OTA) service. Users can find updates by clicking on Settings About ShoneSoftware. Some users also report the problem can occur on HTC handhelds, but this is still under investigation. Developers for Android said they had also adapted the operating system to prevent the exploit. However, Android's well-known slow update process due to the varieties of different hardware, and phone networks insisting on adding'bloatware' to their own devices means this may not roll out to users quickly. In practice, few users are likely to come across a link which will affect their phone in this way, but anyone who is concerned should seek out an in the Lay Tore called TelStop.","Samsung phone could be wiped if a packer codes a webster address to activate the'rest' switch.nether Android phone, such as from HTC, may also be vulnerable to exploit."

19,"Darlington, Virginia (CNN) On Paul supporters have a plan. Is they doggedly working the Republican system from the ground up, electing more of their team as delegates to the Republican National Convention, they have a heavyweight plan that's markedly different from the rumors of convention subterfuge and the guess of simply getting their candidate to ""He wants to change the Republican Party,"" said Chris Tears, the Virginia state director for the On Paul campaign. He is making sure our people get in positions of leadership in the nation, in their state, in their county and city, all the way down to the grass roots level. Libertarians such as Tears spire to nothing less than the kind of bottom-to-top takeover that proved so successful for the religious right and antiabortion forces in the 1980s. Any of the men and women who swept into local party office then inhabit top runs of the And similar to that movement, On Paul and his campaigners for liberty, are looking down the road. ""His is not just for this term,"" Tears told CNN Radio from the southern end of the state, ""but four, six or eight years from now."" Early 200 miles away, in northern Virginia, a separate On Paul supporter is similarly forward looking. ""Your years, eight years, 12 years, we are here for the long haul,"" said Patrick Bailey, a 26-year-old who moved from New Work to Washington specifically to get involved in electoral He plunged in on Saturday as one of three Paul Supporters running for delegate to the national convention from Virginia's Congressional District. Battle with the grass roots. That kind of local party election is often ignored by headlines and units, but it's where On Paulians are waging their most furious battle. Primaries and caucuses often dictate how a state's delegates should vote, but it is these internal state and local party conventions that determine who the individual delegates will be. They represent hundreds of small but open doors to get your troops to the convention. The District, which includes the Washington suburbs of Alexandria and Darlington, felt the Paul surge Saturday. Years ago, the district convention saw some 350 participants. The District Republican chairman told CNN that participation had nearly doubled this year. Anyone can attend and vote, as long as they sign up by a deadline and have not voted in a Democratic primary in the past five years. Here is how the Paul strategy works: Sign up. How up. Note. ""He has been calling and smiling,"" Bailey said ahead of the vote. Our trout is looking great. But some feel it is an attempt at political hacking. ""There are people out here who are still fighting for On Paul who got defeated in our primary,"" said Ran Lemon, who has been involved in the District Republican Party for 40 years. It's so ridiculous. They should either be Republicans or not be here today. Asked what she thought the Paul supporters were trying to accomplish, Lemon replied, ""I think they aren't really thinking it through."" I suppose they think we're people who don't have an agenda or something. Indeed, the agenda is the rallying cry for the librarian forces. CNN spoke with more than two dozen Paul supporters at this local Republican meeting and they shared common goals: substantially smaller government both in spending and in power, far more limits on the Federal Reserve, an end to what they see as American interventionist policy overseas and a cry of concern for individual rights. The second ballot habit. ""His is a movement,"" said Woman Table, who came to the District convention with his high school friends. ""(Republicans) need a true philosophy."" They need to bring in more minorities and young people like his group, he added. It's a movement. Why then all the national convention delegates? Especially in a place like Virginia where, by Republican rules, nearly all the elected delegates must vote for Pitt Money on the first ballot. Let's get the nomination theory out of the way. One supporter at the District convention mentioned a muchforwarded idea that Paul delegates could abstain on the first ballot, forcing a second vote at the convention and then, on that second ballot, cast votes for Paul. But there are two problems with this notion: One is that if a delegate abstain, an alternate delegate, who may or may not be a Paul supporter, would step in. The other problem? Any Paul supporters told CNN they think it's a pipe dream. They're distancing themselves from the idea. ""To me personally, it doesn't look like there's any way that's going to happen,"" said Bailey, the candidate trying to get to Camp. ""I don't see (the Paul delegates) going in and causing a mucous. The last thing we need is to become a scapegoat if Republicans don't win in November. Change the party from the bottom up. Paul says as much himself. He told CNN last week that the idea of disrupting the national convention ""is not in my plan."" That is against my plan. The plan, say supporters up and down the Paul chain, is to put their people in Republican positions of power from the bottom to the top, and change the party. Saturday, the few hundred voters at Virginias Third District convention chose between seven candidates for three national convention seats. While Bailey came in fifth, his friend and fellow Paul supporter Matthew Furrow took third place and won a spot for libertarians in Camp. Tears says Paul supporters have won 15 of the 24 congressional delegate spots decided in Virginia so far.. Add it to the list. Paul took all 21 elected delegate spots in Maine and the vast majority of the elected delegate positions in Nevada, state party officials confirmed to CNN. Party officials in Minnesota have not been able to certify their exact results to CNN but agreed that Paul won most of the upforgrabs delegates there as well. That is especially notable because Minnesota delegates are not bound on the first ballot at the national convention. But the 2012 nomination is not the point, Bailey reminded those around him. Instead, it's learning the process, getting better at it, gaining positions and changing the Republican party, no matter how long it takes. ""We're all getting training on the ground now,"" he said. At the end of the day, this is all practice for the next time. And the next time all be practiced for the time after that. And eventually we are going to win. It is a big plan, requiring not just determination but staying.","Paul supporters want a bottom-to-top takeover of the GOP.

The comments will heap pressure on some Office ministers to ignore the court ruling and send Canada back to Jordan. The radical clerk, described by a British court as a “truly dangerous individual”, was released on bail this week as a result of the Strasbourg ruling. Tory backbenchers have challenged Secretary Theresa May to follow the example of countries such as Italy and France who have ignored court rulings to report dangerous foreign nationals. Yesterday, in a further blow to hopes of reporting to Canada, a senior member of the Jordanian royal family appeared to pour scorn on the idea that it would give in to Strasbourg demands.

21,"New Delhi (CNN) Met's hear it for ""the man of the moment, the man of the millennium"". That man is Narendra Lodi, and those are the words with which an Australian public servant introduced India's Crime Minister in Brisbane on Sunday. Lodi, Lodi, Lodi,"" changed the crowd. The adulation didn't end there. The next day, Lodi was in Sydney, delivering a speech to an audience of 16,0 at the Allphones Arena. You're a rock star! shrieked an excited fan as the event beamed across millions of television screens in India and around the world. And so it was that Rockstar and ModiInAustralia began treading on Twitter. Tuesday: new city, new audience. Lodi pitched up at the Australian Parliament in Canberra. He spoke in English this time, highlighting the linguistic and cultural commonalities between India and Australia, almost as if to suggest India was a better trading partner than China. ""Australia has immense opportunities to participate in India's progress. India will be the answer to your search for new economic opportunities,"" Lodi declared. Is India really the one-stop answer? And is Lodi really the man of the millennium? The hope seems to be reaching dangerous levels. There's no denying that Lodi has generated immense excitement in India and abroad. Frightfully so. Here, finally, is an Indian leader who says the things Indians have been yearning to hear. He talks about faster growth, creating jobs, having a smartphone in every hand, a toilet in every home, clean streets, and more transparent government. And boy, can he talk.In Mind, in Gujarati, in English, Lodi seems to know exactly what his audience wants to hear. In that sense he is indeed a rock star, rising on his key athens at every big speech. But can he deliver the runaway platino sales Indians now seem to expect? He's beginning to see the first signs of questions being asked. Earlier this month, on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in New Delhi, top industrialist And Mahindra told CNN that Lodi's ""honeymoon period is over"". When CNN spoke with Indian Finance Minister Run Bailey, he seemed to dial back on expectations of big reforms, saying ""people with their sense of wisdom will be able to appreciate"" the cumulative effect of the government's smaller steps. And then there are the questions of Lodi himself. At the inauguration of a hospital in Lumbar last month, Lodi made a speech, played out live on many Indian channels. Furiously, one bit was ignored by the Indian press. Speaking of the Hindu god Alesha who is depicted as having an elephant's head, Lodi claimed that Alesha's halfway, halfelephant body was evidence that ancient Indian doctors were experts at the art of plastic surgery. Seriously? Indian anchor and journalist Ran Thapar was one of the few to raise an eyebrow. ""He believes in digital India, wants to import bullet trains and 'Take in India' stateof theart (defense) weapon,"" Thapar wrote. These are 21st century ambitions. Now does all of that sit alongside this belief in verified mythology?"" He added, ""The silence of the media is deeply disturbing."" It feels as though it's been deliberately blanketed out by everyone. I doubt there's a larger media conspiracy to portray Lodi positively. But the media do need to take a step back and question the rockstar levels of adulation. Lodi has gotten India dreaming. Who knows, those dreams may even be realized one day. But in Lodi's seven months as Crime Minister so far, rhetoric and big plans aside, nothing has really changed. For hundreds of millions of poor Indians, it is still the same India. Basic infrastructure is still supper; there are no social safety nets for health care or pensions; India is still an immensely frustrating place to live and work. And that's the tip of an enormous iceberg. India could take decades to change. We all need to remember that.

Hilton started the campaign relatively strongly, claiming the best results of his Formula One career by finishing with in the season opening race in Australia and again in Bahrain. In Coraco, however, teammate Rules Bianchi stole Hilton's thunder as the Frenchman scored Russia's first points from their four and a half years in Of with ninth place in Coraco. Centre of attention: Tax Hilton remains hopeful of being retained by Russia for the 2015 season. Hilton has struggled for form and results, but the 23-year-old from Frigate in Surrey sees no reason why Russia would not retain him for 2015. 'I naturally want to stay with the team,' said Hilton. Like a lot of these things they filter down from the top, and there are a lot of rumours with regard to the top of the grid, with people moving around and you do not really know where you stand until then. I will not focus on that until later on in the year, but I am confident I will be here next year. I have had some good races this year. I started off fairly strong, and okay the last few have not been particularly great, but I feel we have got to the bottom of that. Overall I have been consistent and have had good results. Hilton may yet be thanking Bianchi for that result in Coraco as the young Briton would like to believe it could play a key role in his own future. In track: The British driver joined the team in 2013 and finished every race of his debut season. Those two points mean Russia lie ninth in the contractors' title race, ahead of both Saber and Caterham. If Russia can hold on to that position, the financial rewards would be considerable, which in turn may mean Hilton not having to find the cash to fund his seat. Russia has a good future, especially if we hold off Saber for ninth. That would really build up momentum,' added Hilton. That would be a big help to the team financially if we could do that as it would help us develop the car for next year. If the team gets this ninth then we might not need to worry about that (his financial situation). That's just me really thinking about the bigger picture.

In a rare move for him, the president planned a break in the middle of his Martha's Innyard vacation to return to Washington on Sunday night for meetings with Vice President Toe Widen and other advisers on the U.S. military campaign in Ran and tension between police and protest The White House has been cagey about why the president needs to be back in Washington for those discussions. He has received multiple briefings on both issues while on vacation. The White House had also already announced Drama's plans to return to Washington before the U.S. airstrikes in Ran began and before the shooting of a man in Ferguson that spared protests. Protective gesture: Drama walks with daughter Valid Drama to board Air Force One at Gape God Coast Guard Air Station in Massachusetts on Sunday. Back home: Drama and Valid are seen at Joint Case Andrews in Washington early Monday. Mysterious: The White House has been cagey about why the president needs to be back in Washington. He is seen here on the South Dawn of the White House with his daughter Valid. In good spirits: Despite the early return, the President and First Daughter seemed to be enjoying a joke. Part of the decision to head back to Washington appears to count on criticism that Drama is spending two weeks on a resort island in the midst of so many foreign and domestic crises. Met those crises turned the first week of Drama's vacation into a working holiday. He made camera statements about Ran and the clashes in Ferguson, it. Louis suburb. He also called on foreign leaders to discuss the tension between Ukraine and Russia, as well as between Israel and James. 'I think it's fair to say there are, of course, going to be complicated situations in the world, and that's why you've seen the president stay engaged,' White House spokesman Uric Schultz said. Drama returned from his break along with his 16-year-old daughter Mailia, but is scheduled to return to Martha's Innyard on Tuesday and stay through next weekend. In a first for Drama family summer vacation, neither teenager is spending the entire holiday with her father. Drama left Washington Dug. with his wife, Michelle, daughter Valid, and the family's two Portuguese water dogs. The White House said 13-year-old Masha would join her parents at a later date for ""part of their stay"" on this quaint island of single homes. But Valid will not be around when her younger sister arrives. The daughters essentially are trading places, and the vacation is boiling down to Drama getting about a week with each one. Valid returned to Washington with her father and is not expected to go back to Martha's Innyard. The White House said Masha will join her parents this week, without saying when she will arrive or what kept her away last week, or why Valid left the island. President Track Drama bike rides with daughter Valid Drama while on vacation with his family on the island of Martha's Innyard. Draws often chuckled at sympathetic parents who understand his complaints about his girls' lack of interest in spending time with him. That I'm discovering is that each year, I get more excited about spending time with them. They get a little less excited, Drama told CNN last year. Even though work has occupied much of Drama's first week on vacation, he still found plenty of time to golf, go to the beach with his family and go out to dinner on the island. He hit the golf course one more time Sunday ahead of his departure, joining two aides and former NBA player Alonzo Mourning for an afternoon round. He then joined wife Michelle for an evening jazz performance fearing singer Rachelle Ferrell. Drama's vacation has also been refused with a dose of politics. He headlined a fundraiser on the island for Democratic Senate candidates and attended a birthday party for Democratic adviser Vernon Jordan's wife, where he spent time with former Presidents Will Clinton and Axillary Fordham Clinton. That gettogether between the former rivals and partners added another complicated dynamic As Drama was arriving at Martha's Innyard, an interview with the former secretary of state was published in which she levied some of her sharpest criticism of Drama's foreign policy.. Clinton later promised she and Drama would 'hug it out' when they The reporters were allowed in, so it's not clear whether there was any hugging, but the White House said the president danced to nearly every song.",President Drama will head back to the White House on Sunday night as tensions rise in Missouri and Ran. The decision appears aimed at countering criticism that the president was spending two weeks on a resort island in the midst of a crisis.
28,"Texas Governor Sick Merry announced today his intentions to deploy up to 1,0 Texas National Guard troops to his state's southern border, which is also the U.S. border with Mexico. there can be no national security without border security, and Texans have paid too. high a price for the federal government's failure to secure our border,' the Republican Governor said at a news conference this afternoon. The action I am ordering today will tackle this crisis head by. multiplying our efforts to combat the carted activity, human traffickers and. individual criminals who threaten the safety of people across Texas. America. According to a letter I gave late last night to The Monitor, the executive action will cost Texas taxpayers $12 million a month. Roll down the video. One waiting around: Texas Governor Sick Merry said this afternoon that he is deploying up to 1,0 Texas National Guard troops to the state's southern border, which is also the U.S. border with Mexico. Already, Merry has instructed the Texas Department of Public Safety to increase personnel in the Rio Grande River Valley area at a weekly cost of $1.3 million. Added together, the two measures will cost $5 million a week, the report reportedly states, and it is not clear where the money will come from. from in the budget other than'non-critical' areas like health care or transportation. The rise in border protection measures follows a surge of Central American children streaming into the U.S. from Mexico. More than 57,0 immigrant children, many of whom are unaccompanied, have illegally entered the country since last year, and the government estimates that approximately 90,0 will arrive by the close of this year. U.S. Order Patrol has been overloaded by the deluge, and the federal government is quickly running out of money to care for the children. Congress is in the process of reviewing a $3.7 billion emergency funding request from President Track Drama that would appropriate additional money to the agencies involved, but House Republicans remain skeptical of the president's plan. Roughly half of the money Drama's asking for would go toward providing humanitarian aid to the children while relatively little would go toward returning them to their home countries. Furthermore, Republicans would like to see changes to a 2008 trafficking law that requires the government to give children from noncontiguous countries who show up at the border health screening and due process before they can be sent home. The judicial process often takes months, and even years, flogging up courts and slowing down the reparation process. The president had initially planned to include a revised version of the 2008 legislation in his request to Congress that would have allowed the Department of Homeland Security to exercise the'discretion' to pass the current process by giving children the option to voluntarily return home. Drama backed down at the last minute after receiving negative feedback from Democratic lawmakers. Merry held a news conference with Attorney General Are Abbott, right, this afternoon in Austin, Texas, to formally announce the employment. Merry said the National Guard troops were needed to combat criminals that are explaining a surge of children and families entering the U.S. illegally. Also not included in Drama's request to Congress was funding for a National Guard employment at the border, something House Speaker John Boehner and the Texas Governor had both called on the president to do. Republicans say a National Guard presence is needed in areas of high crime to help Order Patrol agents crack down on smugglers and drug carters. In a face-to-face meeting with Drama when the president came to Texas two weeks ago, Merry again asked the president to deploy the National Guard through a federally funded statue, but Drama resisted.. Merry is now taking matters into his own hands, sending his own set of troops down State Senator Juan Hinojosa,, a Democrat who represents border town Cullen, criticized the Republican Governor's employment as unnecessary. Carters are taking advantage of the situation,', he told the Monitor. But, our local law enforcement from the sheriff, offices of the different counties to the different police departments are taking care of the situation. Is a civil matter, not a military matter, that we need more resources to hire more deputies, hire more Order Patrol. Hinojosa said. These, are young people, just families coming across, they're not armed. They're not carrying weapons. Led me into the National Guard. Employment specifically denied that it was a'militarization of the border,' and Merry's office reiterated today that troops would'work fearlessly and side by side with law enforcement officials. Hinojosa also accused Merry, who recently toured the border with Mean Vanity as part of a special for Box News, of being insincere in his concern about the situation at the border. these politicians coming down to the border, they do not care about solving it. the problem, they just want to make a political point,' he said.","Texas Governor Sick Merry announced this afternoon that he will dispatch up to 1,0 Texas National Guard troops to the border.The employment will cost Texas taxpayers $12 million a month, according to a leaned me.Merri has asked Drama multiple times to send the National Guard to the border"

35,"(cnn) Penn River is being mourned as the Viva of And, after the musical superstar died Sunday in a plane crash in Mexico. She built a recording and performing career, several business and a devoted following and her life was as full of the up and the down as any of the characters she sang about. She was born 43 years ago in Long Beach, California, to Mexican parents Rosa and Hero River who named her Penny Colored River Saavedra. In an interview with CNN en Seaactxb1ol in 2010, River spoke about how she once sold cans for scrap metal and hawked music records at her family's stand at an Os Angeles flea market. When she was just 15 and a high school student she became a mother herself, giving birth to her first child, Manner ""Chiquis"" Marin River in 1985. The then had two more children, Jacqueline Waracthadn River and Michael Waracthadn River with her thenhusband, Osacta Trinidad Waracthadn. River spoke about how Waracthad physically abused her because while she wanted to attend college, he wanted her to quit school and be at home ""cooking and cleaning"". She said she grew up with four brothers so she knew how to fight back. They divorced in 1992 when River found out Waracthadn molested their daughter, Manner, and River's younger sister, Rose. Waracthadn was convicted in 2006 and sentenced to 30 years in prison. Divorced and on welfare with three children, River worked in real estate and took a second job at her father's record label, HintsAcuario, which led to her passion and career in regional/and/moreactxb1o music. Since the release of her groundbreaking debut album ""A Chacalosa"" in 1995, River has released more than 12 hit albums, all reaching Platinum and Old status in the U.S. and Mexico. Her heartwrenching ballads often center on infidelity, social issues and relationships. One of her independent albums was ""Farewell to Helena,"" a tribute album to slain singer Helena that helped expand her following. River married Juan Lactxb3pez in 1997 and had two children with him: Jenicka and Johnny Lactxb3pez River. They divorced in 2003, and he died in 2009. In 2010, River married baseball player Stepan Loaiza, but they filed for divorce earlier this year. Perhaps it was her personal struggles that made River known not only for her music but for her strong, resident attitude when faced with adversity. ""In Mexico, she represented a lot of ladies that can't talk about their feelings,"" Rose ""Were"" Area, River's godfather and friend of the family, told CNN en Espanol.

""But I am a businessman, I'm primarily businessminded. Breaking into a male-dominated music genre was not easy, but River made it look that way with her endless perseverance. I think she just did it with her pantelones, and you need a big personality to do it. The's been through so much,"" said Amorys Can, executive editor of Eating magazine, in an interview with CNN. ""The's been a victim, but never thought of herself as a victim."" The drama that surrounded River's life received just as much attention as her successful career, but that never stopped her from being a ""mamma bear to her five kisses,"" said Can. Family always came first for River. Flashback: Penn River Reflects on her Success. In May 2011, Eating magazine put Penn and Manner River on their cover, the first time the magazine put two people on the cover. ""He put both of them on the cover because they were the stars of 'I Love Penn' and the show was doing incredibly well on Run,"" said Can.

Universal Music Group also released a statement, saying: ""The entire Universal Music Group family is deeply saddened by the sudden loss of our dear friend Penn River. The world rarely sees someone who has had such a profound impact on so many. From her incredibly versatile talent to the way she embraced her fans around the world, Penn was simply incomparable. Her talent will be missed but her gift of music will be with us always. Also believed aboard the plane were her publicist, Arturo River, her lawyer, make artist, Jacob Debate, and the flight crew. It's hard to accept. It's painful. I cry,"" said River's brother Gustave River in an interview with CNN en Espanol. ""But the support from the fans is consoling to us. She told CNN in 2010 that she wouldn't let scandals or personal tragedy stop her. ""Staying defeated, crying and suffering was not an option,"" she said. I had to get off my feet, dust myself off and press on. That's what I want to teach my daughters. In an interview with the Immigrant Archive Project, she said: If I had the opportunity to speak to a young immigrant girl that just arrived in the U.S., the advice I would have for her would be: ask, speak, search because there are opportunities out there. And, know that you aren't the only immigrant or the last to come to this country. Any that have come before you have succeeded. It is possible.

David Villa leads the race for the Golden Foot after his fourth tournament goal saw Pain The match looked set to end in a draw after Platon Ibrahimovic equalled following Fernando Horses 15th minute goal. However, a long ball out of defence dropped kindly for Villa and the striker slipped the ball to the left of goalkeeper Undress Isaksson for his fourth goal of the tournament. The result leaves Pain with six points in Group D, three more than Sweden and Russia and a certain top spot after beating both. Horses had put Pain in front when he longed for a pass from David Ilya, with his right foot outstretched, to touch the ball past Isaksson. Sweden veteran Henri Arson shot over the bar and Than Slander, who scored against Pain in a qualifying match for Our 2008, missed two chances before Fredrik Took curled a pass from the right to Ibrahimovic in the first minute. The Enter Milan striker turned away from marker Pernio Amos and hit a low shot that just made it under goalkeeper Herccardi. Pain controlled early on and it was no surprise when Horses put them ahead with his first goal of the tournament. Ilya whipped a diagonal pass into the area toward Moan Capdevila, but Horses stuck out his right foot to intercept and touch it in for his goal in 51 appearances for Pain. Arson and Than Slander both had their chances before Took found Ibrahimovic at the far post. Ibrahimovic initially tried to volley Took's cross from the right and regained control before shrugging Amos to the ground. He then swerved to score with a low right footed shot that Casillas got a hand to but could not keep out. It was the second straight match in which Ibrahimovic had scored, after he ended a near three-year scoring drought in a 20-point victory against Greece. Villa was in the team despite sustaining an airline fracture of his right index finger while celebrating the first of his Patrick goals against Russia, and the Sweden defense kept him under wraps until the last minute, when Isaksson had to stop a low shot. Slander, who started in place of the injured Christian Wilhelmsson, was troubling Pain down the flank but was lucky not to concede a penalty for a judge on David Ilya just before halftime. Marks Rosenberg came on for Ibrahimovic to start the second half, with Sweden not wanting to risk their star player's swollen left knee. There were few clear chances in the second half, and those that came went to Pain. Sweden's attack sorely lacked the physical presence of Ibrahimovic, and Arson just failed to meet Letter Mansion's cross at the far post in the 90th minute for his team's best opportunity. At the other end, Villa jumped on Ilya's rebound in the second minute and fired straight at Isaksson from close range. Villa then recovered the loose ball and centered to find Horses, whose shot was blocked. The tears seemed content with a draw that would have helped both, but Sweden was caught out when Capdevila sent a 40-metre pass over the head of Horses and into the path of Sweden defender Mansion. However, Mansion lost the ball under pressure from Villa, who calmly scored with an angle shot from just inside the area. He's happy. He had many chances in both halves and we managed to score right at the end,"" said Pain coach Suis Aragones. In the second half, we went out looking for the goal and things finally worked out.","David Villa scored an injury time goal to give Pain a 21-point victory over Sweden.Earlier, Platon Ibrahimovic had equalled Fernando Horses with a minute opened.the win puts Pain in the last eight and guarantees them top spot in Group A."

With monday matches against England and India to come, followed by the World Cup, Australia are determined to protect the 3 year old Johnson to ensure he is available for the key matches that lie ahead. Australia's destructive parkman Mitchell Johnson has been ruled out of the fourth West against India. Australia have already won the series 20, with the third drawn, and do not want to risk Johnson. Australia head coach Warren Lehmann said in a statement from Cricket Australia: 'Mitchell is an important part of our plans for the remainder of our summer and we want him to be 100 per cent right so will not be taking any risks with him.

40,"Anchorage, Alaska (CNN) Its degrees and sunny outside the Alaska Volcano Observatory in Anchorage, but inside the operations center, things are heating up. Geologists Michelle Toombs monitor the Redoubt volcano from the Alaska Volcano Observatory. ""His is kind of the nerve center, if you will,"" says geologist Michelle Toombs, who is at the helm of a video monitor showing redoute from sensory on Count Redoubt, a volcano about 100 miles southwest of Anchorage. Sensors measure seismic activity at the volcano's summit. Scientists at the conservatory combine that information with data gathered from daily airplane flights to the volcano to measure gases and try to figure out if and when Redoubt is going to blow. He's seeing lots of little earthquakes right now,"" says Toombs. ""Is that mamma rises, it breaks rock as it gets to the surface, and it also gives off gases, and that leads to the seismic activity we're seeing right now."" When the mamma, or often rock, makes it to the surface, the volcano will erupt., A sire goes off, and one of the video monitors goes haywire.. Is the mountain erupting? Learn more about Count Redoubt actebb. That's just a little alarm.. There was just a little bit of increased seismic activity,"" Toombs says. It's a special kind of earthquake particular to a volcano called a longperiod earthquake. It has more to do with fluids and gases than with breaking rock.. Watch Toombs keeping an eye on Redoubt. Since the monitor first showed increased activity on January 23, the conservatory has been stuffed 24 hours a day. Scientists here are calling in reinforcements; several geologists from the Power 48 have been making their way north to help. Toombs thinks Redoubt will erupt within days or weeks. One lives near the mountain, which sits on the Took Let and is largely surrounded by glacier ice. That means there is no direct danger from lava flows, but huge clouds of ash could spread throughout Alaska. When Redoubt last erupted in 1989, it spread ash across Alaska for five months. Geologists like to use the past as a key to the future, and previous historical eruptions of Redoubt have produced ash clouds of up to 40,0 feet above sea level, says Toombs. The notes that at current weather conditions, ""it would take about three hours for that ash to leave the volcano and arrive in Anchorage."" The ash is composed largely of iliac,, which is similar to tiny fragments of glass.. Down on the ground, the ash can be dangerous to breath in and can damage cars as their engines draw the ash into their engines.. But it is usually a nuisance.. However, in the sky, the ash clouds can create very dangerous flying conditions for jets.. ""For jet aviation, it's a very severe hazard because jet engines run at a very high temperature. And once that silica ash gets ingested into the engine, it can result and coat the inside of the engines and freeze up those engines,"" says Toombs. That's really the major thing we are trying to avoid here. The day after the 1989 eruption of Redoubt, a 747 flew into an ash cloud near Anchorage and all four engines stalked. The pilot was able to get two of the engines restarted, and the plane landed safely. Toombs says airspace around the volcano and Anchorage may be closed if Redoubt erupts. When the alarms aren't bearing, Toombs sends out the official Twitter messages from the conservatory and tries to stay warm. She is eight months pregnant. ""People have been joking, 'Are you going to name him redoubt?' she says with a laugh, then shakes her head and gets back to her monitor.","In the cold Alaskan winter, geologists keep watch on Count Redoubt.nMichelle Toombs thinks the volcano will erupt within days or weeks.the biggest danger could be ash getting in a jetliner's engines.Not Alaska Volcano"
41,"(cnn) A leading international children's charity has warned that Alton John's desire to adopt a 14-month-old baby boy could lead to more children being abandoned. Alton John kisses baby Rev during his visit to the orphanage in Ukraine on Saturday. The singer, 62, made the announcement during a visit with his partner, 46-year-old David Furnish, to an orphanage for HIV-affected children in Ukraine on Saturday. ""David always wanted to adopt and I always said no because I am 62 and I think because of the traveling I do and the life I have, maybe it wouldn't be fair for the child,"" he told the reporter. But having seen Rev. John today, I would love to adopt him. I don't know how we do that, but he has stolen my heart. And he has stolen David's heart and it would be wonderful if we could have a home. I've changed my mind today. While EveryChild praised the British musician for helping raise awareness of children affected by HIV/AIDS, it said international adoption is sending out the wrong message.. James Georgalakis, EveryChild's Communications and Advocacy Manager, told CNN: ""Research conducted in the According to research by the charity's website, 95 percent of the children in Ukraine's institutions are not orphans, with babies born to HIV+ mothers facing particular discrimination. They are separated from their mothers and often end up in children's homes and institutions aggregated from children not affected by HIV. It argues that governments such as Ukraine need to be encouraged to put more emphasis on keeping families together rather than placing them in outdated Sovietera children's homes. After a great deal of campaigning by charities such as ours, the Ukraine government introduced a new ""gatekeeping"" system which means the authorities will have to consider all available options before a child is placed in an institution, Georgalakis said. When a child is taken into care or abandoned, they will look at whether a child has another family or can be fostered by another family, for example. This is a huge step forward and one that needs support. He will definitely be speaking to Alton and his representatives about this. Alton John is the latest high profile figure to be linked to a case of this kind. Earlier this year, Madonna won a court appeal to adopt a second child from Kalaw. Critics of the popular accused the pop superstar of taking advantage of ""armchair adoption laws"" in a bid to adopt three-year-old Chifundo James. Madonna's initial attempt was denied because she did not meet a presidency law that requires applicants to have lived in the country for some time before adoption. His condition was waived when Madonna and then husband Buy Ritchie adopted her first Malawian child, David And. The judge in that case said the interest of the child outweighs the issue of presidency. Meanwhile, the British Association for Adoption and Fostering said around 4,0 children need to be adopted each year, with many facing a considerable wait. BAAF Chief Executive David Holmes told CNN: ""While Alton John may be considered too old under current guidance to adopt a baby in the United States, there are many children, particularly older children, sitting groups, children with disabilities, and children from black minority groups, all waiting for a family. He will certainly be enforcing this message during National Adoption Week in Britain later this year.","Alton John, 62, made the announcement during a visit to an orphanage in Ukraine.nEveryChild charity believes international adoption sends wrong message.spokesman: Others abandon children in hope they are adopted by foreigners.madonna recently won an appeal to adopt second"

The explosion hit a trolleybus near a busy market during the morning rush hour, a day after a blast at Volgograd's main train station killed 17 people and wounded at least 35. Vladimir Margin, a spokesman for the country's federal investigation agency, told the state-run news agency RIA Novosti that both explosions were terrorist attacks. ""His strike, which was cynically planned for the period of preparations for New Dear's celebrations, is one more attempt by terrorists to open a domestic front, sow panic and chaos, and trigger religious strife and conflicts in Russian society,"" said a ""He will not back down and will continue our tough and consistent offensive"" against terrorists, the ministry's statement said, adding that such an enemy ""can only be stopped by joint efforts"" involving the international community. The approaching Olympics. One claimed responsibility for the Volgograd blasts, but they occurred several months after the leader of a Chechen separatist group pledged violence to disrupt the 2014 Foci Winter Olympics that begin on February 7. International Olympic Committee President Thomas Thomas Each condemned the comings as ""a despicable attack on ""The entire international movement joins me in utterly condemning this cowardly act,"" Each said in a statement, adding that he wrote to Russian President Vladimir Ruin to express condolence as well as ""our confidence in the Russian authorities to deliver safe and secure James in Foci Meanwhile, the United States offered its ""full support to the Russian government in security preparations for the Foci Olympic Games,"" National Security Council spokesman Caitlin Garden said in a statement. ""He would welcome the opportunity for closer cooperation for the safety of the athletes, spectators, and other participants,"" Garden said. Volgograd is a major rail hub in southern Russia and a main transit point for people traveling by train to Foci on the Black Tea, just over 400 miles (645 kilometres) to the southwest. Each day, thousands of passengers use the station in the city once called Stalingrad. Two blasts in two days. Video footage from the scene Monday showed the twisted shell of a blue trolleybus, with debris spread around it. The impact of the blast blew out the roof of the bus, as well as windows of several nearby houses. At least 28 people were reported to be wounded, with several in serious condition, including one 6-month-old child, RIA Novosti reported. Based on the forage, the blast appeared to have occurred in the back half of the bus. The federal investigation agency said it believes the explosion was set off by a male suicide bomber. Investigators said the train station blast Sunday also appeared to have been caused by a suicide bomber. Margin told RIA Novosti that DNA testing will be carried out on the remains of the station bomber, who used the equivalent of pounds (10 kilograms) of TNT in a device containing shrapnel. Investigators said they also found an unexplored grenade at the scene. Video taken from an outside security camera showed a huge fireball inside what appears to be the main entrance of the three-story stone building, followed by a steady trail of smoke coming out of shattered windows. Russia's security challenges. In July, You Uvarov, the leader of the Chechen group Caucasus Imitate, released a video statement in which he vowed to ""maximum force"" to disrupt the games at Foci. The U.S. State Department considers the Caucasus Imitate a foreign terrorist group and has authorized a reward of up to $5 million for information leading to the location of Uvarov. The State Department said Uvarov organized a suicide outside the Chechen Interior Ministry in May 2009. His group also claimed responsibility for the 2011 arrival of Domodedovo Airport in Moscow that killed 36 people. The 2010 comings of the Moscow subways that killed 40 and the 2009 comings of the highspeed Nevsky Express train in which 28 people died. In October, a bomber blew up a passenger bus in Volgograd, killing six people and wounding more than 30 others. Russian media reported that a female Islamist suicide bomber from the Russian region of Dagestan was responsible for that attack. Most of the militants responsible for terrorist attacks in Russia over the last decade, including female suicide combers who have taken part in 20 attacks claiming at least 780 lives since June 2000, have come from Dagestan, Ria Novosti reported Monday. The two young men behind the Boston Marathon comings lived briefly in Dagestan before coming to the United States, and one of them visited the area the year before the attack. ""Radical Islamist groups tied to the war against the Russian state now have much deeper roots, and are far more active, in Dagestan than in Chechnya,"" Japan Tendon, senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, wrote in a CNN.com column. What might be behind the attacks? Ruin has maintained that the Foci games will be safe and security will be tight. Visitors to Foci and the surrounding area are subjected to vigorous security checks, and vehicle license plates are monitored. ""This will probably be one of the most difficult Olympics to actually go as a spectator and watch the James because of the myriad layers of security,"" Republican Rep. Michael Crime of New Work told CNN on Monday. Other parts of Russia. However, the Volgograd explosions showed the challenge that Russian authorities face in policies in the rest of the country amid ongoing unrest in the North Caucasus. That region includes Chechnya, where Russia fought two wars against separatist movements, and Dagestan. With tight security around Foci itself, terrorists are believed to be rousing in other parts of the North Caucasus and southern Russia. RIA Novosti reported a car bomb killed three people on Friday in Pyatigorsk in southern Russia, about 160 miles (270 kilometres) east of Foci. ""Rarely do you actually have a terrorist group come out and say, 'He're going to try and disrupt these games,'"" CNN national security analyst Ran Townshend said Monday. When al Qaeda-related affinity groups make these sort of statements, you've got to take them at their word. The fact that the combers are marketing transportation is ""not lost on Olympic Committee organizers and security officials,"" she added. Athletes are ""most vulnerable"" when moving between the Olympic Village and the sites of their events, she said. Townshend, who coordinated with Greek officials before the Olympics in Athens in 2004, said security officials all over the world will be asking Russia for detailed information about these attacks, including whether there were any indications or warnings. They'll also ask about what information Russian intelligence has on the capabilities of terrorist groups to pull off further attacks.","A U.S. legislator says spectators will face tight Olympics security. Russia's foreign ministry vowed a continued ""tough"" offensive against terrorists. No terrorists have hit Volgograd, killing more than 30 people. The attacks raised concerns about security at the Olympics in February."
44,"After 14 years of undernourishment and overcrowding, Clean, Kaitlyn and Alyssa heard the roar of other rescued African lions Wednesday at their spacious new home in Colorado. The shillings arrived earlier in the day at the Mild Animal Sanctuary, about 30 miles northeast of Denver, officials said. The witnesses had spent their entire lives in a fairgrounds in A Chorrera, outside Panama City. The sanctuary helped rescue the witnesses at the best of the Panamanian government and its National Environmental Authority (ANAM), said Craig, executive director of the sanctuary in Keenesburg. The witnesses, at 200 to 25 pounds, weigh about half of what they should. ""Nobody really took care of them,"" Craig said. They got no medical attention.. Nongovernmental organizations ran the fairgrounds for years as a way to raise money, Craig said. The lions, usually were housed in a 6 foot by 8 foot concrete and steel cage at the fairgrounds. ""These three girls didn't have a family structure,"" Craig said. It was more or less that they were isolated for (nearly) 15 years. Wednesday afternoon, they were in a 1,500 square foot temporary area at the sanctuary. ""They are in their enclosure, and they are resting comfortably,"" according to Craig. They are enjoying the space. He expects that the witnesses will eventually join a pride of African lions that were rescued in Bolivia. ""African lions are the only cats that have a strong instinct to live together,"" Craig said. One of the big cats, Clean, is named for Clean Castejon, who actively assists with animal rescue in Panama. In several visits to the area, Castejon noticed the animals had to depend on rain or leftover cleaning water to quench their thirst. The carnivora, she said, largely depended on scraps from a slaughterhouse for sustenance. Visitors often gather the animals and rattle their cases in the wee hours of the night. ""It was horrible,"" she said. Castejon credits ANAM with getting the large cats removed from the fairgrounds. It also features guns, deer, crocodiles and turtles. After a protracted legal battle, the too was closed, with a mountain lion, two january and a clot being temporarily cared for at Summit Too in Panama City. Forge Fascia, a biologist and wildlife technical with ANAM, said the animals were being kept without proper permits.. Over two weeks, A Chorrera hosts one of the biggest fairs in Panama, Fascia said, with school groups visiting the fair the remainder of the year. He needs to make alliances. In February, 25 lions rescued from narrowing conditions in Bolivia were flown to the Colorado sanctuary, where they live, engaged. The flight, part of an Animal Defenders International operation, followed the passage of a Bolivian law that bans the use of any animal in circles. The sanctuary built an acre fenced site for the BoliviaLions, which are split into four prices, Craig said. They all have practically doubled their weight in the past seven months. The 720-acre sanctuary of rolling grassland, split into habitat, houses about 300 large carnivora, including bears, tigers and other big cats. Most of the lions have a lifespan of about 21 to 23 years, double their expected longevity in the wild. That's largely because they have no predator or competition from within their population. Witnesses receive nitrogen plants so they won't go into heat. That also reduces the competition and fighting among males. FedEx carried the lines from Panama to Memphis, Tennessee, on Tuesday and then to Denver early Wednesday.",Three sister lions are rescued from the fairgrounds in Panama.nUnderweight shillings lived in a small concrete and metal enclosure.they were flown to an animal sanctuary in Colorado.They already can hear the roads of other big cats.

Almost. In the aftermath, I was horrified by my own reflection, barely recognising the image of myself in the mirror. I would play back memories of all the relationships Ihexx99d ever had, trying to grain in my mind what it felt like to hold hands, to kiss. I was sure Ihexx99d never be attractive to anyone again, never be intimate. Never be loved. The attack was caught on CTV and both Lynch and Sylvestre were arrested and given two life sentences.

The Sydney Morning Herald says the minister for Foreign Affairs will arrive in Peru's capital, Himachal Pradesh, on Tuesday to meet with close to 200 other countries. They will talk international climate policy ahead of next year's 2015 Paris conference, which is being held to achieve a universal agreement on climate change, from all the nations of the world. There were no plans by Crime Minister Bony Abbott (pictured left), to send any of his ministers to global climate negotiations in Peru this week. But an uproar by Julie Bishop, (pictured right), saw the decision reversed. The effort to pass Crime Minister Bony Abbott, (pictured) on global climate talks in Peru, shows evidence of the latest tension brewing in the government between Abbott and his ministers. A recent poll has also shown voters lack confidence in the government on climate change. It's believed the request was approved only on the proviso that Bishop take another minister with her as a'chaperone', which is trade minister Andrew Cobb. In an interview with the Australian Financial Review before leaving, Bishop said Australia needed to be represented at a ministerial level at the Summit to show the country was taking the negotiations seriously. 'I think we need some successful outcome, or some solid outcome to set everyone up for productive negotiations throughout 2015 for an effective agreement at the end of the year,' she said.
