250,"The 25-year-old has agreed a three-year contract at the Madejski Stadium.
His arrival comes after it was revealed veteran striker Yann Kermorgant will miss the start of the season following surgery on his hip and groin.
Bodvarsson joined Wolves from Kaiserslautern last summer, scoring three goals in 48 appearances.
""Jon is the type of player who can play in our system and he is able to play in a number up different positions within that system too - up front as a central striker, as one of a two or as a winger,"" Royals boss Jaap Stam told the club website.
""He's a strong runner, he's tall but he's very comfortable on the ball, he's got some pace, so he's definitely a player who will be a useful addition to our squad.""

251,"But Belgian-born Dutchman Max Verstappen was unable to drive a car legally on his own in either country.
That all changed on Wednesday when the youngster turned 18 and passed his driving test at the first attempt.
Despite having competed in 14 grands prix since his debut in Australia in March, Verstappen admitted to feeling the pressure during his test.
""It's a relief,"" said the Toro Rosso driver, who finished ninth in Japan on Sunday and had only started driving lessons a week ago. ""I was a bit nervous to make mistakes, but the exam went well.""
A bonus of turning 18 is that Verstappen will now be able to drink the champagne if he ever makes it onto the podium.",He is Formula 1's youngest ever driver and in charge of a car that can reach over 200mph.
252,"European leaders gathered in the Polish port of Gdansk for a midnight ceremony at the site where the first shots of the war were fired.
The Gdansk commemoration was seen as a slight to Russia's Victory Parade on Saturday, which has been boycotted by Western leaders because of Ukraine.
There will also be ceremonies in Paris, London, Berlin, as well as Washington.
The commemoration in Gdansk was marked with a 21-gun salute on the stroke of midnight. Beams of light illuminated a monument to Polish defenders in Westerplatte and the national anthem was played.
In a speech, Poland's President Bronislaw Komorowski said the war had started with the co-operation of two totalitarian regimes led by Hitler and Stalin.
He went on to say that the victory over Nazi Germany in 1945 did not bring freedom but instead communism and the Iron Curtain. Such division finally ended, the president said, with the integration of the region into the European Union.
The event was attended by the UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon and the presidents of several countries including Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Lithuania, Romania and Ukraine.
But many other Western leaders - who are boycotting Moscow's event and for whom the Gdansk commemoration was partly organised - did not attend.
Among those in Gdansk was Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko who said it was possible to draw parallels from history and the current situation in Europe.
""Annexation and invasion, under the pretext of defending ethnic minorities... could all become the new reality,"" he said.
Relations between Russia and the West have been soured by Russia's annexation of Ukraine's southern Crimea peninsula last year and support for rebels in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions.
Moscow denies it is arming the rebels and sending troops across the border.
Russia, which lost more citizens to the war than any other nation, will stage its biggest-ever military parade during its Victory ceremony in Moscow's Red Square on Saturday.
Later on Friday, there will be a ceremony in Germany where President Joachim Gauck will lay a wreath at a cemetery for Soviet soldiers. The German parliament will meet in special session.
In London, a remembrance service will be held at the Cenotaph and 200 beacons will later be lit across the country.
In France, where VE (Victory in Europe) Day is a national holiday, President Francois Hollande will lay a wreath at the tomb of the unknown soldier at the Arc de Triomphe in Paris.
In the US, a ceremony will be held at the national World War Two memorial in Washington followed by a flypast of vintage fighter planes.
It was on 8 May 1945 that Allied forces accepted the unconditional surrender of Nazi Germany, marking the end of the war in Europe. But it was not the end of WW2. It would take another three months before Japan surrendered.",Events are being held across Europe to mark the 70th anniversary of the end of World War Two on the continent.
253,"The midfielder, 27,  has been inundated with messages of congratulations on social media following the birth of Raine on Friday night.
Chairman of AFC Bournemouth Jeff Mostyn was among the first to congratulate Arter and his partner Rachel, tweeting: ""Thrilled with the incredible news.""
Their daughter Renee was stillborn in December 2015.
AFC Bournemouth also congratulated Arter on the news, tweeting: ""From one family to another, congratulations.""
Arter responded to the support on Twitter, saying: ""Thank you to everyone for all of your kind messages"", adding an emoji rainbow and a heart.
""Rainbow baby"" is a phrase used by some parents who have lost a child through a miscarriage or stillbirth as they compare their subsequent child to a beautiful sight after a storm.
TV cameras caught an emotional moment after Bournemouth's match against Manchester City on Monday when City manager Pep Guardiola embraced Arter and offered his best wishes for the imminent birth.
Arter said at the time: ""He's someone I have massive respect for. I watched his Barcelona teams and he is, without doubt, the best manager in the world.""
Messages have also been sent to the couple from numerous other clubs and fans.
Leeds United's Liam Cooper tweeted: ""Congrats mate"", while a section of the club's fans tweeted: ""Lovely to see the football world come together to congratulate you - congrats Harry.""

254,"The former Northern Ireland international, who died last week, was remembered with a minute's applause and a video tribute following a career that saw him score more than 140 goals for the club.
On the pitch, however, the Bantams were looking for a response to the loss at Roots Hall and they started in positive fashion.
Mark McNulty and Nicky Law each had shots deflected for corners and Bradford twice appealed in vain for a penalty, with Hanson and McNulty both going down inside the area to no avail.
The hosts continued to press after the interval as Haris Vuckic and Law went close before the home side's pressure paid off in the 56th minute.
Vuckic's overhit cross from the right was kept in play by Mark Marshall, who clipped the ball into the area where Hanson scored with a header from close range.
However, Northampton came close to equalising when only a brilliant one-handed save by Colin Doyle kept out Alex Revell's header from Paul Anderson's cross, before substitute Marc Richards had the ball in the net in the 84th minute only to be ruled offside.

255,"The ""truly wicked, marauding mob"" stabbed Sean McHugh, 19,  with a ""sword stick"" in Anfield on 30 September 2013.
Reese O'Shaughnessy, 19, was jailed for a minimum of 18 years after he was convicted alongside four others.
Andrew Hewitt, 15, Keyfer Dykstra, Corey Hewitt and Joseph McGill, all 14, were also detained by Liverpool Crown Court.
Dykstra was sentenced to a minimum of 12 years, Andrew Hewitt and McGill were sentenced to a minimum of nine years and Corey Hewitt for a minimum of six years.
Judge Clement Goldstone described Mr McHugh's killers as ""a marauding mob"".
""Each of you has been convicted of the murder of Sean McHugh - a truly wicked attack in which each of you played different roles,"" Justice Goldstone said.
A victim impact statement from Mr McHugh's mother Lorraine that was read in court said: ""They might as well have killed me.""
The teenagers were part of a gang known as the Lane Heads, a rival gang to the Walton Village Heads which Mr McHugh was linked to.
Months earlier, Dykstra was stabbed in the chest by a member of the Walton Village Heads and wanted to ""avenge that stabbing"", the court heard.
""The stabbing was avenged not by attacking the person responsible, but by attacking someone... by virtue of his affiliation to the Walton Village Heads,"" Justice Goldstone said.
The gang targeted Mr McHugh, of Beckett Street, Liverpool, after a minor dispute and found him at the Priory Road launderette, where he had left his washing, at about 19:00 BST.
Armed with knives and the makeshift sword stick, described as similar to a broom handle but with a blade attached, the gang forced the back door to the room where Mr McHugh was hiding.
He was beaten and stabbed before the group ran out.
Mr McHugh escaped and was found in an alleyway having been stabbed in the groin. He died a few days later in hospital from blood loss.",Five teenagers who murdered a man in a Liverpool launderette when some of them were 13 years old have been sentenced.
256,"Serial burglar Darren February, 34 and of no fixed address, denies breaking into Mr Cowell's west London home while he was asleep in December 2015.
Isleworth Crown Court heard traces of Mr February's DNA was discovered on a glove found dropped nearby.
It was also found on a mark on the side of the entrance steps, the court heard.
A forensic expert said the discovery meant it was possible that the defendant, who has been convicted of 37 burglaries, wore the gloves to steal a diamond ring, earrings and watches, before discarding them near the Holland Park home.
Traces of other people's DNA were also found on the items tested, expert Sara Short said.
In their report Ms Short and Rachel Pollard found that while ""one possible explanation is that he had worn the gloves and discarded them"" on 4 December, 2015, they could not conclusively state that he had ""handled, worn or had direct contact with the gloves or had contact with the area (on the wall).""
In cross examination, Ms Short agreed it was possible the defendant's DNA could have been transferred on to the gloves without him having worn them.
But she agreed with prosecutor Denis Barry who suggested it would be unlucky for the defendant to have his DNA transferred to and found at the scene, if he had never been there or committed the crime.
The court heard from a police officer who said he initially thought a man who broke in to the home of singer Rita Ora was pictured on CCTV from Mr Cowell's address.
Two other officers said they had been able to identify Mr February from images captured at the scene.
The trial continues.","DNA of a man accused of stealing Â£1m worth of jewellery from Simon Cowell's house was found on a glove at the music mogul's home, a court has heard."

The Dons took the lead when Jonny Hayes' corner landed at the near post, with Caley Thistle's Gary Warren deflecting in Ash Taylor's shot.
Greg Tansey headed wide for the visitors, while Hayes, Kenny McLean and Niall McGinn all missed for the Dons.
Miles Storey should have made it 2-0 but somehow got the ball caught under his feet on the goal line.
The result moves Aberdeen 13 points clear of third-placed Rangers, with the two sides set to meet on Sunday at Pittodrie.
Aberdeen may have been unable to mount a serious title challenge this season, but they are still on course for a record points tally after surpassing the run of home wins set by Sir Alex Ferguson's side in 1986.
They now need 12 points from the last seven matches to do that, but an overall run of 12 victories in their last 14 Premiership matches suggests they are up to the task.
Aberdeen impressed with their pace, intensity and variety of movement going forward in the first half, but the defence remains equally effective as they have now gone 531 minutes without conceding a goal.
Of course this was another painful night for Caley Thistle manager Richie Foran in what has been a steep learning curve for the Dubliner in his first season in the job.
No team in British senior football have won fewer league matches than the Highlanders this season and, while they are not yet entirely cut adrift at the bottom, time is fast running out to turn things around.
The sight of five former Caley Thistle players in such an impressive Dons squad was compounded by the knowledge that current top league marksman Greg Tansey is moving to Pittodrie in the summer.
The midfielder is desperate to leave with the club still in the Premiership, but he missed one of their best chances of the evening when he headed a Henri Anier cross over the bar from six yards in the first half.
The real disappointment for Foran, though, will be that the goal they conceded was a gift for Aberdeen.
It was poor marking by the Caley Thistle defence as Dons pair Taylor and Andrew Considine contested a Hayes corner, the ball eventually deflected in by captain Warren off Taylor's strike.
Despite a battling performance, Caley Thistle simply could not find a way back into the match.
They did have a late let off, though, when former Inverness player Storey had an incredible miss when he failed to convert from point-blank range after a Hayes shot came off the post.
Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes: ""We didn't have the same rhythm or flow to our game as we normally have, but there were a number of factors for that as we had the game in our pocket but didn't know whether to stick or twist.
""We are delighted to get the 10th home win on the bounce for the first time since that great Aberdeen side in 1986 with so many top players and a top manager in Sir Alex Ferguson.
""That keeps the distance between us and Rangers and we just look forward to playing them here on Sunday now but we have a lot of hard games left.""
Inverness CT manager Richie Foran: ""We had chances to go one up but we didn't take them then we give a goal from a set-piece which was really disappointing.
""We work hard on defending those so it was a sloppy goal to give away and Aberdeen looked more confident than we did.
""We are not going to be judged on games against Aberdeen though. We have seven must win games left and I believe we can still get enough points to get out of trouble.""

259,"Typhoon Phanfone has killed at least one person, a US airman on Okinawa who was washed away by high waves.
Thousands of households have lost power and Japan's two largest airlines have suspended many flights.
The storm also forced the suspension of the search for people missing after last week's volcanic eruption.
The storm-tracking website Tropical Storm Risk forecasts that Phanfone will rapidly lose power over the next few hours as it goes further into the Pacific Ocean.
Typhoon Phanfone was downgraded from an earlier status of a super typhoon, but the Japan Meteorological Agency had warned it was still a dangerous storm.
Japan averages 11 typhoons a year, according to its weather agency.
The typhoon made landfall on Monday morning near the central city of Hamamatsu, with winds of up to 180 km/h (112 mph).
The airman was one of three US military personnel swept away by high waves whipped up by the typhoon off southern Okinawa island, where the US has a large military base. The remaining two are still missing.
A police spokesman said they had been taking photographs of the sea.
A university student who was surfing off the seas of Kanagawa Prefecture, south of Tokyo, was also missing, national broadcast NHK reports. It said at least 10 people had been injured and 9,500 houses were without power.

""It's not a nice position to be in and I wouldn't recommend it.

Hull KR's Ben Cockayne described the concept as ""a disgrace"" and said it hurt the Rugby Football League's efforts to promote good mental health.
Salford looked destined for relegation as the highly charged game at the Lightstream Stadium drew to a close.
They trailed 18-10 with two minutes left but Niall Evalds' try and Greg Johnson's score with the last play of normal time levelled the scores.
Gareth O'Brien's drop-goal in golden-point extra time secured victory to save his side from the drop to the Championship.
""At one stage I thought it was all over, but credit to the boys they dug deep and found a way to win,"" added Kopczak, who was among the Salford replacements.
""It's not good for the players but it is what it is. You've got to do it and someone's got to go down.
""Hopefully next season I'm not in that situation again. We've got a great bunch of lads and we shouldn't really have been in that situation.""
With Salford's Super League status secured, Kopczak's focus is now on another challenge - captaining Wales' attempt to reach the 2017 Rugby League World Cup.
Wales, who won the European Championship in 2015, have qualifiers against Serbia at Llanelli's Stebonheath Park on Saturday and away to Italy on 29 October.
""We've got two tough games and it's going to be interesting,"" Kopczak said.

But Kopczak says his own Super League experience, as well as that of Salford team mate Phil Joseph and Widnes pair Gil Dudson and Lloyd White, will help Wales.

262,"Allen scored his first international goal on his 32nd appearance in Wales' 4-0 win over Moldova in their opening 2018 World Cup qualifier.
The 26-year-old joined Stoke City from Liverpool for £13m in July after only starting eight league games in 2015-16.
""I think it had come to the point where I needed to move on,"" Allen said.
""Personally, it was pretty obvious.
""Any player will tell you regular football makes tonnes of difference to the way you perform and the way you feel out on the football pitch.
""It comes to a certain stage in your career where if it's not happening then you have to go and seek it out.
""Hopefully I will get much more game time now and I think that is going to be really important for me in my international career as well.""
The Wales international joined Liverpool from Swansea City for £15m in the summer of 2012. He had a year left on his contract at Anfield but joined Stoke after starring for Wales at Euro 2016.
Allen has been impressed by the calibre of players fellow Welshman Mark Hughes' has assembled at Stoke City.
Manchester City striker Wilfried Bony signed on a season-long loan on transfer deadline day and joins a squad which includes Xherdan Shaqiri, Bojan Krkic and Marko Arnautovic.
""It's pretty obvious that my type of play would not have suited Stoke years ago,"" Allen added
""But the likes of Shaqiri, Arnautovic, Bojan, (Ibrahim) Afellay and (Giannelli) Imbula, players they have brought in - and others that were already there (Glenn) Whelan, Jonathan (Walters) and (Peter) Crouch - the list went on and on.

""It made it really appealing to me, and was one of the big reasons why I signed there.

""On a personal note to get the goal was a nice bonus as well.

263,"And, on a drive between the Republican Convention in Cleveland, Ohio and the Democratic Convention in Philadelphia, I gained an insight into another factor adding to the unpredictability - the growing numbers of Americans who are switching, or thinking of switching, party allegiances. In some cases, they are changing the voting habits of a lifetime.
The first switcher was just a few blocks from the Republican convention location. Tim - who didn't want to give his last name - is a lawyer who works in Cleveland's Key Tower, the tallest building between Chicago and Philadelphia. A lifelong Republican, he believes that Mr Trump is not just telling tall stories, but dangerous ones.
""I am very concerned about any leader who appeals to the worst instincts of human nature. That's very dangerous for the country and I love my country more than I love my party.""
So will he vote for Hillary Clinton? ""I may. I haven't quite got there, but I definitely won't vote for Donald Trump. Anyone who knows me knows how ridiculous that sounds, that I would even think of voting for her.""
I heard a very different view in the run-down town of Warren, 50 miles east of Cleveland. At the 422 restaurant, the only place to eat on what local people say was once a bustling strip, I met a group of disillusioned Democrats. They used to work at the town's steel mill, which is now nothing more than a fenced-off patch of wasteland.
As jobs, opportunities and hopes have disappeared, so too has the loyalty they felt - or were encouraged to feel by the unions - towards the Democratic Party. During the 35 years that Joe Shrodek worked in the mill's blast furnace, he always voted for Democratic presidential candidates. But not this time.
""When I was there I voted Democrat the whole time, the unions endorsed [the candidate]. All that's gone now. I just want change, that's all. They need to clean house in Washington.""
So, is Mr Trump the man to do that?
""I don't know,"" he says, ""but I'm voting for him.""
Watching Joe and his friends mop up the restaurant's roasted hot pepper dip with slices of white bread, local Republican Party chairman Randy Law predicts that Mr Trump will soak up the votes of many other white working class voters like them.
""I see it every day. People calling me, emailing me. There is this anti-Hillary feeling. People seeing it as a third term for Obama. People are fed up with a lot of those policies that have hurt big business, small business and trade and people are tired of being politically correct.""
Crossing the state line into Pennsylvania, another swing state, where polls suggest a tight contest, I encountered a different type of switcher. Judie Radel, who owns the Yee Haw farm in Duncannon, has always voted Democrat. She was a Bernie Sanders supporter in the primaries. Patting her ""girls"" - the milk cows she tends on the 160 acres she farms - she says that she's leaning Republican.
""I don't trust Hillary. We've had eight years of a Hillary administration and I think we need change.""
She says that she enjoyed Mr Trump's speech at the Republican convention. ""I like that it was a doom and gloom speech that didn't sugar coat what's going down in our country. Our country's in dire straits right now. We need to wake up.""
She expresses some misgivings about a Trump finger on the nuclear button, but doesn't think it disqualifies him from the White House.
An hour south-east of Yee Haw farm, in Pennsylvania's more affluent Lancaster County, Ann Womble is rather more concerned. She has been an active Republican Party member for 30 years and was a delegate to the 2012 convention in Tampa.
But the Trump takeover has led her to take a big decision - she's just cancelled her party membership. She dismisses comparisons between the reality TV star, Donald Trump, and the Hollywood actor, Ronald Reagan, who first attracted her to the party.
""Reagan's candidacy was a sunny, happy conservative insurgency into the Republican Party, because it was optimistic. Now, we're in the opposite place. Trump is attracting people to his candidacy for dark, gloomy and dangerous reasons.
""His view is of an autocratic, almost Third World leader. If he were actually president of the United States and tweeting these things that he tweets all hours of the day, saying these things to camera, it could be apocalyptic.""
But, despite that assessment, Ann can't bring herself to vote for the Republican Party's bogeywoman, Mrs Clinton, in November. Although she'll support Republican candidates for Congress, she may not vote in the presidential election at all.
And that represents one of the challenges for the Democratic Party.
While disillusioned Democrats are embracing Mr Trump, disillusioned Republicans find it much harder to support his opponent. Mrs Clinton's convention may project a positive vision of America. But to really succeed it needs to address and counter the negative impression that many Americans have of her.","Donald Trump's nomination as the US Republican Party's presidential candidate has been a huge shock to the American political establishment, confounding the forecasts and questioning the models for predicting the outcome of November's election."

267,"The figures for the Walmart-owned supermarket, filed at Companies House, confirm a torrid spell for Asda as it faced stiff competition in the grocery sector.
Like-for-like sales were down 5.7% compared with the previous year.
Pre-tax profits dropped almost 19% to Â£791.7m at the Leeds-based company.
""The grocery market has continued to experience low growth throughout the year and competition in the sector has remained intense. Our sales performance, relative to the market, was behind our expectations,"" the company said.
Asda, Tesco, Sainsbury's and Morrisons - the so-called big four UK supermarkets - also face competition from German discounters Aldi and Lidl.
Asda suffered more than most and, unlike others, has struggled to fight back. In May, it reported decreasing sales in the first quarter of 2017 - the 11th consecutive quarter of falls - as it continued to lose ground to its rivals.
However, Asda added that despite the disappointing results, there had been an improvement following ""strategic changes"" under new boss Sean Clarke.
Mr Clarke, who replaced previous chief executive Andy Clarke a year ago, has slashed the prices of everyday items as he attempts to arrest falling sales.
The chain reported a 2.8% fall in like-for-like sales in its first quarter of this year, a moderate improvement on the previous period, which saw sales fall 2.9%.
Analysts have said that a major turnaround is required at Asda.
""Sainsbury's and Tesco have always had more opportunity for differentiation from the discounters, but Asda has chosen to focus on price rather than range and in-store experience, which has clearly been the wrong strategy,"" said Tom Berry, retail analyst at GlobalData.
""Asda has been flailing without direction for too long, and a comprehensive plan is needed if it is to survive in the highly competitive UK grocery market.""
Phil Dorrell, of consultancy Retail Remedy, is a previous marketing chief at Asda. He said that it was a difficult market for Asda and it ""had a lot of catching up to do"".
""It is not changing significantly or fast enough to pull around the results. It did not get its proposition right,"" he said.",Sales falls and lower profits at supermarket Asda in 2016 have been revealed in detail in newly-filed accounts.
268,"Five guards are also missing and are believed to have aided the mass prison breakout in Nuevo Laredo town.
Mexican police say the majority of those on the run are drug traffickers and members of armed gangs.
The prison system is struggling to cope with an influx of offenders arrested in a campaign against drugs cartels.
Correspondents say prison breakouts are not uncommon in northern Mexico, where more than 400 inmates have escaped since January 2010.
Nuevo Laredo, in Tamaulipas state, lies just across the border from Laredo, Texas.
The largest jail break so far was last December when more than 140 prisoners escaped from the same prison.
According to a statement from the Tamaulipas state government, the riot began on Friday morning in Nuevo Laredo's Sanctions Enforcement Centre, which houses an estimated 1,200 prisoners.
After the breakout, soldiers surrounded the jail and calm was restored, the authorities said.
The northern border region is the scene of rising lawlessness as the cartels fight the security forces and each other for control of smuggling routes into the US.
The main battle in Tamaulipas is between the Zetas and the Gulf cartels, the AFP news agency reports.
Their capacity for violence and ability to pay huge bribes gives them considerable power to subvert the prison system and get their people out.
President Felipe Calderon came to power in 2006 promising a war on drugs.
More than 35,000 people have died in drug violence since he began his campaign, which has involved launching an army assault on drug gangs.","Seven prisoners have been killed and 59 others have escaped after a riot at a jail in northern Mexico near the US border, officials say."
269,"The play, written by Jack Thorne, is set 19 years after the seventh and final book in the series by JK Rowling.
It opens officially at the Palace Theatre, in London's West End, on Saturday.
Audiences have been urged to ""keep the secrets"" since the play began previews in early June.
Presented in two parts, the play - showing the stars of the wizarding saga as adults in their mid-30s as their own children head off to school - stretches over five hours.
Daily Telegraph critic Dominic Cavendish awarded the play five stars, writing: ""British theatre hasn't known anything like it for decades and I haven't seen anything directly comparable in all my reviewing days.""
He said ""those involved can give themselves a pat on the back"", adding: ""It's a triumph. Not an unqualified one - there are some quibbles - but in all key respects, it grips, it stirs, it delights.""
Cavendish praises the ""thrill-a-minute"" stage craft which sees pupils heading to Hogwarts, at the start of the play, change into school uniforms ""in the blink of an eye"" as they head to the infamous Platform 9Â¾ to make their way to school.
The Stage also gives a five-star review, with Mark Shenton describing Harry Potter and the Cursed Child - co-devised by Rowling, with director John Tiffany and playwright Jack Thorne - as a ""truly game-changing production and a thrilling theatrical endeavour"".
It is an ""entirely original"" piece of work, with ""Dickensian sweep and momentum to the storytelling"", writes Shenton, adding: ""It earns its place on the stage, feeling distinct from both the books and the screen adaptations.
""By turns playful and gripping, disturbing and detailed, poignant and powerful, it is superb family entertainment.""
Shenton also praises ""the theatrical wizards who've created this stunningly-realised alternative universe deliver one coup de theatre after another"".
In a nod to the Kings Cross platform number, Ann Treneman gives the play four and three-quarters stars in The Times, saying the ""wizardry on display"" is ""out of this world"".
She says the plot is complex (""there are mazes that are more straightforward"") but adds: ""It's a raunchless Game of Thrones with heart. Crucially, it's authentic Potter but, most importantly, it's new.
""It's not the movie of the book. It's the real deal, live in front of you, so much better than any film could be.""
In The Guardian, Michael Billington noted the Cursed Child will make more sense to ""hardened Potterheads"", but applauded Tiffany for directing a ""thrilling theatrical spectacle"", giving it four stars.
He praised the strong performances that meant acting was central to the story, despite the dazzling special effects, singling out Sam Clemmett as Harry's son Albus, ""wonderfully quirky"" Anthony Boyle as his friend Scorpius Malfoy, and the adult Harry (Jamie Parker), ""authoritative"" Hermione (Noma Dumezweni) and ""bluntly commonsensical"" Ron (Paul Thornley).
It's another five stars from The Independent, with Jack Shepherd describing it as ""magical"". He argues Part One should be billed as a magic show, due to the effects used, also praising its moments of comedy.
Shepherd adds: ""It's quite apparent this isn't written to be either a book or a tie-in film; it's a spectacle for the theatre, one that is filled to the brim with fan service and magical imagery that will amaze.""
Quentin Letts grumbles about the length of the play in the Daily Mail, noting: ""There were moments I could have done with a glug of gurdyroot infusion to keep me alert.""
But he admits: ""Potter addicts will love it. JK Rowling is going to make (another) fortune. The West End's ornate Palace Theatre, itself a little like Hogwarts, has a hit probably for years.""
Variety describes it as ""spellbinding"", Matt Trueman writing that it is: ""The Show That Lived Up to Expectations â€” and Then Some.""
He says the relationship between Albus and Scorpius is ""the friendship of two bullied boys bound together, and it's a beautiful, tender thing"", adding: ""The script by Jack Thorne recognizes that rejection breeds resentment, and outsiders stew into outcasts.
""No one's born a villain, nor sees themselves as such, and where the books gave us stock baddies, Cursed Child fleshes them out.""
Chris Jones, in the Chicago Tribune, says that ""heretical as this may sound"", the play left him ""quietly lamenting that the movies were ever made"".
Ben Brantley in the New York Times writes: ""Like the novels that preceded it, The Cursed Child is stuffed with arcana-filled plots that defy diagrams and baldly wrought sentimental life lessons, along with anguished dives into the earnest, tortured solipsism of adolescence.
""By rights, such a combination should try the patience of any grown-up. But like Ms Rowling's books, the play vanquishes resistance.""
The Harry Potter books have sold more than 450 million copies since 1997 and been adapted into eight films.
The script of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is published this weekend.

270,"There were celebrations in Europe after Germany surrendered.
But on the other side of the world in the Pacific Ocean, Japan was still fighting against America, Britain and their allies.
The Americans, however, had a secret plan to end the war - by using the most powerful weapon ever created.
On 6 August 1945, at 8.15am Japanese time, an American B-29 bomber plane, called 'Enola Gay', dropped an atomic bomb on the Japanese city of Hiroshima.
The devastation was beyond anything seen before. The city was immediately flattened.
80,000 people were killed as a direct result of the blast, and another 35,000 were injured.
Even then, Japan didn't surrender.
Three days later, another nuclear bomb was dropped by the Americans on the Japanese city of Nagasaki.
Shortly afterwards, on 15 August 1945, Japan finally admitted defeat.
World War Two was over.
When the bomb exploded in Hiroshima, the city has struck by a flash of blinding light then a giant cloud shaped like a mushroom.
The blast flattened buildings within a 2.5 km radius of the bomb.
There were 90,000 buildings in Hiroshima before the bomb was dropped but only 28,000 remained after the explosion.
Thousands and thousands of people were killed.  Many were badly injured.
But the suffering didn't end there because it wasn't just a normal bomb.
The nuclear radiation released when it exploded caused people to suffer horrible illnesses.
Thousands more people died from their injuries and radiation sickness in the weeks, months and years that followed.
Japan was at war with America and its allies, which included Britain and Soviet Union (a nation made up of modern-day Russia and other countries).
The allies were winning the war and the Japanese forces had been pushed back from many locations.
However fighting was still very fierce and soldiers and civilians were dying every day.
Japan had been at war for many years.
It had invaded the countries near to it such as China and the Japanese had attacked America.
Everywhere the Japanese soldiers went, they were known for their cruelty.
They treated prisoners of war very badly, including  American and British soldiers who had surrendered.
US President Harry S Truman wanted the Japanese to surrender as quickly as possible so he could save lives.
The atomic bomb was a deadly new weapon.
President Truman hoped the massive destruction it caused would shock the Japanese into realising they had to surrender.
US President Truman wanted to avoid a land invasion of Japan.
There were 2.5 million Japanese troops stationed there and Truman's staff estimated that defeating them would cost the lives of 250,000 US soldiers.
Some historians also say that the US wanted to avoid Japan being occupied by Soviet troops.
America and the Soviet Union were allies but they did not really trust each other.
It was the first and only time that atomic bombs have been used in a war.
Although the scientists who made the bombs were proud of what they'd achieved, it scared them as well.
The way the atomic bomb was built meant it had huge power - enough to destroy whole cities on it's own.
Many people now believe that the devastation caused in Hiroshima, and in Nagasaki, was so awful that the bombs should never be used again.
Today, a small number of countries around the world, including USA, China and the UK, have nuclear weapons.
Some campaigners argue that there is no place for nuclear weapons and that all countries should get rid of them immediately.
Others say that having such terrible weapons will keep a country safe, even if they are never used.","In 1945, World War Two - the biggest war the world had ever seen - was coming to an end."
271,"Alistair Fitt, vice chancellor of Oxford Brookes, was giving evidence to the Education Select Committee, holding a special away-day session at the University of Oxford.
With the elegant panorama of Pembroke College behind them, the MPs wanted to find out what would be the impact of Brexit on the UK's university sector.
You would be hard-pressed to find any sector in the country more opposed to Brexit than higher education.
So it was probably no surprise that the MPs heard an unrelenting message that leaving the EU was a grim prospect for higher education and research.
University organisations, which usually put much effort and ingenuity into not really being for or against anything in public, took to open campaigning for a Remain vote.
Universities, bastions of liberal thinking, intensely international in their outlook and staffing, seemed culturally allergic to Brexit.
And the referendum result hangs over them like they've fought and lost a civil war.
Professor Catherine Barnard from the University of Cambridge told MPs that her own university had seen a 14% drop in applications this year from EU students.
The university had asked why potential students had turned down a chance to study at Cambridge - and she said among the reasons were fears over an ""anti-immigrant sentiment"" and uncertainty over the future of the UK's involvement in international research.
Prof Barnard warned that talented mathematicians at Cambridge from countries such as Hungary, Poland and Romania would take their sought-after skills elsewhere.
The committee of MPs heard warnings that in some elite research institutions in the UK, vital to the national infrastructure, as many as two thirds of the staff were EU nationals from outside the UK.
Would they hang around and see if they were still wanted after Brexit? Or would research rivals in Germany or China snap them up to the detriment of the UK economy?
Showing how seriously they take this, Oxford University has appointed its own head of Brexit strategy.
So you could say that at least Brexit has already created one extra job.
But this new postholder, Professor Alistair Buchan, saw leaving the EU as threatening to relegate the UK's universities behind their global competition.
Oxford has been ranked as the world's top university, but Prof Buchan said that in 1970s the UK's universities did not have that top status. This had been built through the EU years and growing networks of international partnerships.
He described Brexit for universities as the ""Manchester United problem"".
Why would any football team with international ambitions deliberately want to restrict its access both to better talent and to bigger markets?
There were warnings about the financial impact of losing European research funding.
The UK's universities are among the biggest winners from Horizon 2020 research network, bringing more than Â£2bn into the higher education sector.
This is no small-biÃ¨re, with some individual universities worrying about the loss of hundreds of millions.
If the UK is to stay ahead in research, Dr Anne Corbett of the LSE said the UK government had to be ready for some ""serious funding"".
Professor Stephanie Haywood, president of the Engineering Professors' Council, warned that losing access to EU students would make skills shortages in engineering even worse.
But could there be an upside in higher tuition fees?
If EU students are designated as overseas students after Brexit, UK universities could charge them much higher fees.
But such a tuition fee windfall depends on those students not staying at home or going somewhere else.
Prof Barnard raised the example of those talented eastern European mathematicians.
Would they really be able to pay Â£17,000 or so a year? Or would it mean that universities in the UK would have pay for scholarships rather than see them go elsewhere?
Committee chairman Neil Carmichael pushed his witnesses for more evidence and facts.
But what came back most often was even more questions. What's going to happen to the EU staff in UK universities? What will be the visa system for students?
What will happen to the intricate networks of European research? How much will the UK government be willing to cover for any lost income?
And of course, so far, these are unknowns being piled up on unknowables.
But as another European refugee scientist, Albert Einstein, once said: ""If we knew what we were doing, it wouldn't be called research.""","A ""hard Brexit"" would be the ""biggest disaster"" to have hit the UK's universities for many years, a university head told MPs."
272,"Six men and two women were killed when the minibus they were in collided with two lorries near Milton Keynes.
Ryszard Masierak, 31, and David Wagstaff, 53, have been charged with eight counts of causing death by dangerous driving.
The first victim has been identified as minibus owner Cyriac Joseph, 52.
Wipro, an IT services company, said three of its employees were also among those who died, and a fourth staff member had been critically injured.
""It is with deep regret and sadness that we confirm the passing away of three of our colleagues, Karthikeyan Ramasubramaniyam Pugalur, Rishi Rajeev Kumar, and Vivek Bhaskaran in a tragic road accident in the UK,"" a spokesman for the firm said.
""Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of all those who lost their lives in this tragedy.""
It is understood the men were all contracted to work in Nottingham.
A service was held in memory of Mr Joseph on Sunday at St Paul's Church, Lenton, Nottingham.
Father Biju Joseph, who conducted the Mass, confirmed Mr Joseph's wife and children, a 19-year-old man and girl aged 15, who attended the service, were told of his death by police on Saturday morning.
He said the prayer service was a ""great relief"" for them.
""It's so sad and we're praying to God for his soul and his family,"" he said. ""People are really shocked, he was such a good friend. He was like a brother to me.""
Alex Daniel, a friend, said Mr Joseph was a ""great leader"" within the south Indian community in Nottingham.
He said: ""I'm not surprised by the amount of people who came here [to the service]. We got calls from across the country showing concerns for the family.""
A five-year-old girl, a man and a woman were left with life-threatening injuries in the crash, and are still critically ill in hospital. Another woman has serious injuries.
Thames Valley Police said the vehicles were all travelling in the same direction southbound between junctions 15 and 14 at Newport Pagnell at about 03:15 BST on Saturday.
Some of those on board the minibus, which carried branding for the Nottingham-based firm ABC Travels, were visiting the UK from India, police said.
Friends of Mr Joseph, who was also known as Benny and originally came from the Indian state of Kerala, paid tribute on social media.
""My dearest friend Benny passed away this morning after a huge road accident happened in M1 in London,"" said Soyimon Joseph in a Facebook post.
""Hearty condolences. I never thought yesterday 10pm you say thank you to me it was our last meeting.""
Another Facebook tribute read: ""Words cannot describe how helpful you are. You are there when we need you. You are my big brother.

273,"The UK is holding its breath, waiting for the results in the coming weeks of the long-delayed Chilcot enquiry into those events.
It is also agonising over whether to join the Americans and others in extending its bombing campaign  from Iraq to Syria against the militants of the self-styled Islamic State (IS), whose rise is widely seen as a consequence of the 2003 invasion and the ensuing upheavals.
Since the outset of the Syrian crisis in 2011, the Americans and their Western partners have been mesmerised by the chaos in Iraq as an object lesson for how not to deal with Syria.
That is the overriding reason why they have long tiptoed around the prospect of embroilment in the Syrian affair.
US President Barack Obama was elected specifically on a platform of ending such foreign adventures, not getting caught in yet another one.
It was only with extreme reluctance that he found himself drawn into the air campaigns against IS in both Iraq and Syria, with limited and cautious engagement of advisers and special forces on the ground.
It was all very different back in 2002 and 2003, when the neo-conservatives then in the ascendant in Washington were looking for any pretext to move against Iraq and topple Saddam Hussein, as part of a broader ambition to shape a ""new Middle East"".
Ahmed Chalabi, who had left Iraq in 1956, at that time headed the umbrella opposition grouping in exile called the Iraqi National Council (INC).
Viscerally dedicated to the overthrow of Saddam Hussein, Chalabi found himself point man for an opposition effort to persuade the Americans to invade and rid the country of the feared dictator, having despaired of other methods such as trying to engineer an internal coup.
He found himself knocking on an open door.
If he knowingly misled Washington with dodgy intelligence on Saddam's non-existent weapons of mass destruction and links with international terrorism, he knew that powerful American circles were willingly taking the bait without scrutiny as they prepared for their war of choice.
They were using him, and he was using them.
With the Chilcot conclusions looming, Tony Blair, who led the UK into the Iraq war alongside the Americans, came out recently in a CNN interview with a qualified apology for the fact that the intelligence on which the invasion was based was false and that insufficient thought had been given to what should happen next.
But Chalabi entertained no such misgivings. In conversations late last year, he was still exultant at his own role in triggering the invasion which unseated Saddam Hussein. For him, that was the overarching goal that justified any possible means.
But it was not just the removal of the dictator that plunged Iraq into the chaos which has continued to shake and fragment the country ever since.
In the months that followed, every political and security structure holding the country together was dismantled, including the all-pervasive Baath Party (a process in which Ahmed Chalabi played a role), the army and the intelligence services.
Thousands of highly experienced officers and officials from Saddam Hussein's minority Sunni community were sent home with a burning grudge, setting the scene for the subsequent Sunni-based insurgency, sectarian fragmentation and blood-letting, and the eventual emergence of IS.
IS began in Iraq and later spread to Syria, where it could exploit the chaos and vacuums caused by the civil war to entrench and grow, eventually erupting back into Iraq with the storming of Mosul last year.
Now it is firmly entrenched in both countries, and the prospects for pulling both of them back together as unitary states are daunting, given the degree of fragmentation in both.
That is the spectre haunting the West, as it ponders how to deal with a crisis that has sent millions of refugees into neighbouring countries, and hundreds of thousands flooding into Europe.
Doing nothing may increasingly not be an option. But the fate of Iraq since 2003 underscores the potentially disastrous dangers of ill-conceived meddling.","The unexpected death of Ahmed Chalabi has highlighted the burning issues still haunting the UK and the West, long after the key role he played in manipulating the US-led invasion and overthrow of Saddam Hussein in 2003."

275,"""It would be a fundamental forward step for Wales,"" said South and Mid Wales Chambers of Commerce president Liz Maher.
Meanwhile, a business confidence plan and a £5m jobs and growth fund have been announced by First Minister Carwyn Jones, as a response to Brexit.
He hosted an extraordinary meeting of the Council for Economic Renewal.
It brought together business leaders, the TUC and senior politicians to discuss the impact of the UK's withdrawal from the European Union.
It was set-up in response to the financial crisis and meets around three times a year.
This was thought to be its first extraordinary meeting.
Prime Minister Theresa May has already met with Mr Jones and says Wales and the other devolved nations will have a role to play in negotiations.
The first minister said the Welsh Government wanted to assure businesses and inward investors that Wales remains open for business.
""The EU referendum result has created uncertainty and instability which can damage business confidence and have a longer-term impact on jobs and investment,"" he said.
Mr Jones is allocating £5m to the new Growth and Prosperity Fund to ensure the economy continued to grow and Wales continued to be an attractive destination for investment.
""These actions will support Welsh businesses looking to grow and increase the number and scale of Welsh-based companies that are exporting,"" he said.
""We will also be engaging with businesses about how we can support them and promoting Wales with potential inward investors.""
Ms Maher said EU funding and the labour skills gap, which would influence future immigration policy, were some of the issues which needed answering in Wales.
""There's such a long way to go but there are opportunities there,"" said Ms Maher.
She said as well as stability for the economy there needed to be action and the taskforce would bring together the ""huge amount of experience"" and specialist knowledge from business.
The business confidence plan - outlined by Economy and Infrastructure Secretary Ken Skates - includes discussing what support Finance Wales could bring and also bringing forward a plan for export support.
The Welsh Government is also planning an all-age apprenticeship programme and a campaign to support tourist businesses.
Details on how to apply to the Growth and Prosperity Fund will be available shortly.
The leader of the Welsh Conservatives Andrew RT Davies called for a ""spirit of conciliation"".
He said: ""Today's calls for a taskforce to deal with Brexit are sensible, but the first minister needs to reach out to people from both sides of the referendum campaign.
""Brexit presents Wales with significant opportunities and poses questions that could be best answered by a diverse range of voices - not just a chorus of politicians who opposed leaving the EU.""",Business leaders in Wales have called for a taskforce to deal with the implications of the referendum result.

Of those planning to watch, 26% of people said their reason for watching was the ""amusing commentary"", which will again be provided by Graham Norton, 19% are planning to make fun of the show and just 9% say they tune in because they like the music.","The UK would make its mind up to leave the Eurovision Song Contest if there were a referendum, a survey suggests."
277,"US Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel said the Americans will leave RAF Mildenhall in Suffolk and RAF Alconbury and RAF Molesworth in Cambridgeshire.
The move is part of a programme to save £320m ($500m) a year across Europe. The USAF lease the RAF bases.
Mr Hagel said he understood it would mean job losses and thanked those who had supported the US Air Force.
""I know that this will result in a reduction of our local host nations workforces at some locations; I value the tremendous support they provided us for decades.""
The USAF KC-135 tanker fleet based at Mildenhall will be moved to Germany.
RAF Lakenheath, with two squadrons of new F-35 jets (48 of them) arriving by 2020, will be the aircraft's only European base.
The Pentagon said the loss of about 2,000 US military and civilian personnel is due to relocation away from Mildenhall, but will be offset by the addition of about 1,200 people stationed permanently at Lakenheath.
Matthew Hancock, West Suffolk MP and Minister of State for Business, Enterprise and Energy, said he would support the community affected.
Mildenhall had a long and proud history of strong relations with the United States Air Force and the move ""will come as a shock to many"", he said.
""I have met with the defence secretary, and others in government to ensure we can work, together with the American administration, to support the community.
""We will create a Mildenhall, Alconbury and Molesworth (MAM) Working Group, which I will chair, inviting local LEPs [local enterprise partnerships], councils, the Ministry of Defence and US representatives to ensure no stone is left unturned in supporting Mildenhall and the surrounding area.""
A UK Ministry of Defence spokesman said: ""The US Department of Defence (DoD) has been reviewing its requirement for bases across Europe as part of (its) European infrastructure consolidation review.""
RAF Mildenhall is used as a transport hub by the USAF and is home to air refuelling tankers and special operations forces.
It has about 3,200 military personnel, with 400-500 UK civilian staff employed there.
Both bases are in the Forest Heath District Council area.
James Waters, leader of the council, said: ""The USAF contributes significantly to the local economy so the expansion of RAF Lakenheath, and with it the US government's commitment to the site as part of its long term plans, is very welcome.
""But this happiness is obviously tempered by our sadness that Mildenhall is to close.
""Both announcements mean huge changes to the landscape of Forest Heath , but I am optimistic that with every change there are opportunities for reinvention, growth and investment.""
For some years now the US military has been reviewing its bases in Europe, eager to reduce its footprint to rationalise and cut costs.
In part it is due to budget constraints but it is also driven by strategic changes as the Pentagon turns its gaze increasingly towards the Asia-Pacific.
RAF Mildenhall has been an important base for the Americans since the early 1950s when it was home to strategic bombers.
Currently it houses US Air Force Special Forces and a fleet of air-to-air tankers.
The latter, though less glamorous than fast jets, are some of the most important elements of the USAF, described by one analyst as the ""kryptonite"" of modern air power.
They enable combat and support aircraft to reach their targets and to remain over combat zones for the time needed to carry out their missions.
It is likely that the KC-135 tankers from Mildenhall will move to a US base in Germany.
British defence sources are eager to stress that the base closures here - two US-run communications stations at RAF Alconbury and RAF Molesworth in Cambridgeshire are also to shut down  - do not represent any dilution of Washington's commitment to European security.
Indeed RAF Lakenheath is due to host two squadrons of new F-35 aircraft when they enter service.
Over recent months the Americans have deployed small but significant reinforcements to Europe to reassure NATO allies like Poland and the Baltic republics in the wake of Russia's actions against Ukraine.
The US had hundreds of tanks in Europe during Cold War but there was a brief moment after 2013 when all US tanks had been withdrawn from Europe.
Today about a battalion's worth are back in Europe exercising with allies.
But the Pentagon has plans to store an armoured brigade's worth of equipment - some 150 tanks along with other armoured vehicles  - in Europe by 2015.
RAF Alconbury and RAF Molesworth are used as USAF communications bases, rather than for flying, and their operations were expected to move to RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire.
The USAF has about 750 military personnel at the two Cambridgeshire bases, with a further 1,500 civilian employees and dependents.
Jason Ablewhite, leader of Huntingdonshire District Council, said the news was ""hugely disappointing"" as both bases contributed about £40m a year to the local economy.
He said it would mean the loss of 760 personnel and 1,500 civilian jobs, adding: ""The impact on the local economy could be considerable.
""However, the Enterprise Zone is on the same site as RAF Alconbury, and will provide thousands of jobs over the coming years.""",The United States Air Force (USAF) has confirmed it will pull out of three UK airbases.
278,"Ms Borst, 81, helped push through legislation in 2001 that made the Netherlands the first country to legalise euthanasia.
Forensic scientists were unable to say why she died. Police have said it was either an accident or a crime.
Ms Borst, who was a medical academic, served as minister from 1994-2002.
Her body was found on Monday evening and the area around her home near the central city of Utrecht was cordoned off.
Initial inquiries proved inconclusive, however police on Tuesday ruled out death by natural causes.
A full post mortem examination will now take place at the Netherlands Forensic Institute, they say.
""She may have had an accident after she felt unwell, but that cannot yet be said with certainty,"" a police spokesman told Dutch media. ""So we cannot yet say whether any crime may have been involved.""
A spokesman had earlier told Dutch radio there were no indications of anything untoward happening.
Els Borst had appeared at a conference of her liberal D66 party on Saturday and her death came as a shock to political colleagues in The Hague.
For a time, she led her party in the 1990s and Prime Minister Mark Rutte said her death was a great loss for Dutch politics.
""She ensured a breakthrough in the field of euthanasia for which very many people are still grateful,"" said Health Minister Edith Schippers.
She was also behind legislation governing the use of tissue from aborted foetuses for medical research.","Dutch authorities have begun an investigation into the death of former health minister Els Borst, whose body was found in her garage by a friend."

Under previous administrations, the director and joint chiefs attended all meetings of the NSC's inner circle, the principals' committee.
The National Security Council (NSC) is the main group advising the president on national security and foreign affairs.
It is led by retired lieutenant-general Mike Flynn, who was one of Mr Trump's closest advisers and most ardent supporters during the campaign.
""The security threats facing the United States in the 21st century transcend international boundaries,"" Mr Trump's executive order said.
""Accordingly, the United States Government's decision-making structures and processes to address these challenges must remain equally adaptive and transformative.""
Last week, Mr Bannon described the US mainstream media as ""the opposition party"", saying it should ""keep its mouth shut"".
The site he once managed, Breitbart News, serves up an anti-establishment agenda that critics accuse of xenophobia and misogyny. Under Mr Bannon, it became one of the most-read conservative news and opinion sites in the US.
Mr Trump also ordered a restructuring of the Homeland Security Council.
In two separate measures, the president ordered:","President Donald Trump is reshuffling the US National Security Council (NSC), downgrading the military chiefs of staff and giving a regular seat to his chief strategist Steve Bannon."

But struggling to meet costs, Ms Boyko raised ??3,500 online and called her ""the people's cow"".
Now Cornish accountant Martin Sands, who saw the news story, has agreed to pay ??65 a month for ongoing keep.
Mr Sands said it was ""not a normal thing"" for him to sponsor a cow as he did not have a particular interest in animals.
But he said Jean Jeanie was ""a really beautiful cow"" and he was overwhelmed by her story.
""Some of her sponsors had promised income for 12 months and then dropped out, so I promised to fund her for 12 months - probably longer.""
The cow was spotted alone in a field by Ms Boyko who, after hearing she might be destined for market, purchased the animal.
The 52-year-old made a Facebook page for Jean, short for the cow's registered name of Mooridge Jeanie, which attracted donations.
""She lit my days up and I'd like to think I cheered her up. She's got a lovely character, she's really gentle, she's lovely.
""She is the people's cow,"" she added.
Ms Boyko said on her Facebook page that Jeanie and her Cornish sponsor got along well: ""I am pleased to say he was most impressed to meet the beautiful Jean and she was on her best behaviour.""
She added the cow was ""so much better than this time last year - what a difference a year makes"".",The future of a cow saved by a crowd-funding campaign has been secured after a sponsor agreed to fund its keep.

289,"His was not the only voice warning of the dangers of AI - Elon Musk, Bill Gates and Steve Wozniak also expressed their concerns about where the technology was heading - though Professor Hawking's was the most apocalyptic vision of a world where robots decide they don't need us any more.
What all of these prophets of AI doom wanted to do was to get the world thinking about where the science was heading - and make sure other voices joined the scientists in that debate.
That they have achieved that aim was evident on Wednesday night at an event in Cambridge marking the opening of the Centre for the Future of Intelligence, designed to do some of that thinking about the implications of AI.
And Professor Hawking was there to help launch the centre. ""I'm glad someone was listening,"" he told the audience.
In a short speech, he outlined the potential and the pitfalls of the technology in his usual vivid language.  He reviewed the recent rapid progress in areas like self-driving cars and the triumph of Google's DeepMind in the game of Go - and predicted further advances.
""I believe there is no deep difference between what can be achieved by a biological brain and what can be achieved by a computer.  It therefore follows that computers can, in theory, emulate human intelligence â€” and exceed it.""
That, he said, could lead to the eradication of disease and poverty and the conquest of climate change. But it could also bring us all sorts of things we didn't like - autonomous weapons, economic disruption  and machines that developed a will of their own, in conflict with humanity.
""In short, the rise of powerful AI will be either the best, or the worst thing, ever to happen to humanity.  We do not yet know which.""
So, an easy enough mission for the Centre for the Study of Intelligence - just find out whether AI is going to kill us or not.
Actually the multi-disciplinary centre,  which brings together philosophers, psychologists, lawyers and computer scientists,  will have a rather more practical programme of research.
Long before the robots decide whether we are surplus to requirements,  we are for instance going to need to think about issues such as whether autonomous vehicles should be programmed to protect pedestrians or passengers.
Another speaker at the event was Professor Maggie Boden, a major figure in artificial intelligence research for more than 50 years.
She told me she had long seen the need for the debate we are having now - but she was not worrying about our imminent extinction and was rather less convinced than Professor Hawking that we were heading into the AI future at breakneck speed.
Her concern was about the impact of automation right now - in Japan at least - on elderly people.  She pointed to the enthusiasm for the use of robots in the care of the elderly and sick and said society would have to ask whether this was dehumanising. ""I'm scared of that,"" she said.
After decades of research into AI,  Professor Boden still does not see robots replacing humans in functions which require empathy and emotional intelligence. Artificial intelligence could soon offer governments the chance to cut growing bills for social care - but at a cost for those in need of  help.
Just one of the issues which will now be addressed by the Centre for the Future of Intelligence - and rather more urgent than the threat from some future Terminator.

His twin brother Darren said the family were ""still fighting for acknowledgement that David was let down"" by Northumbria Police.
The force said the family's legal case against it would go to court in 2016.
Family members claim Northumbria Police did not do enough to warn staff that Moat had told a 999 call handler he was hunting for officers on the night of the shooting. The force denies this.
Traffic officer PC Rathband was finishing his shift in a marked patrol car when he was shot twice by a shotgun fired by Moat.
He survived but lost his sight in both eyes.
Moat had shot Samantha Stobbart, who survived, and Chris Brown, who died, in Birtley, Gateshead, the previous day hours after his release from prison.
Following a week on the run, the former nightclub bouncer turned the gun on himself during a stand-off with police in Rothbury on 10 July.
After he was shot, PC Rathband founded the Blue Lamp Foundation to help injured 999 workers, wrote a book about his experiences and became a national figure.
However, he struggled to cope with the consequences of losing his sight and the father-of-two, 44, killed himself at his home in Blyth, Northumberland.
His brother, who lives in Australia, said of the 4 July anniversary of the shooting: ""As a family we obviously reflect on past events that had such a tragic outcome for David.
""It means we understand more than most the risks the emergency services, especially police, are asked to face on a daily basis.""
He said the dangers faced by officers from acts of terror was ""very pertinent"" following attacks in Tunisia, France and Kuwait.
""Sadly, David will not be the last police officer injured in the line of duty; three officers have been shot and numerous have been hurt in the UK since 2010,"" he said.

BT had been expecting such action after it launched its own case against Google in 2011.
That dispute has yet to be resolved.
""We have always seen litigation as a last resort, and we work hard to avoid lawsuits,"" said a spokeswoman for Google.
""But BT has brought several meritless patent claims against Google and our customers - and they've also been arming patent trolls.""
The term ""patent troll"" describes firms that acquire patents so that they can later extract settlements from companies on infringement claims.
In 2012, New Jersey-based intellectual property owner Suffolk Technologies sued Google and US internet service provider AOL over two patents it had acquired from BT.
In addition, Steelhead Licensing - another firm which owns patents but does not produce products of its own - has filed a case against 14 handset makers and mobile networks, including Google's Motorola unit, claiming infringement of a wireless technology which used to be owned by BT.
A spokesman for the British firm said it did not comment on pending litigation.
Google has struck back with claims that BT has infringed a method to allow PCs to use an internet-based telephone system based on a patent originally filed by Fujitsu.
And it says BT failed to license a system used to let computer servers prioritise data - an IBM invention now owned by the search firm.
Patent consultant Florian Mueller said this was the first clear case of Google suing another company over its patents.

Tries from Teimana Harrison, George North and Jamie Gibson wrestled Saints back into it, before Burns and Stephen Myler traded kicks to make it 27-27.
But Tigers, boosted by the return of Manu Tuilagi, stole it at the death.
England centre Tuilagi, who ended speculation linking him with a move away from Leicester by signing a new contract last month, had not played since October 2014 because of an ongoing groin problem.
But the 24-year-old came on for the final 29 minutes against Northampton, demonstrating his trademark physicality as Leicester eventually broke their resistance with the final kick of the game.
Richard Cockerill's side, comfortably beaten by Saracens last week, had looked to be cruising to victory when tries from Smith, McCaffrey and Williams, who was later taken off with a suspected broken jaw, put them in command after a dominant opening quarter.
But Harrison's score following a line-out catch-and-drive moments before half-time gave Saints hope, and North ran from deep inside his own half to drag them to within four points early in the second period.
Shortly after Northampton had a further try through Paul Hill ruled out for a high tackle, two Burns penalties stretched Leicester's lead back to 10 points - only for Gibson's touchdown against his former club and Myler's penalty with five minutes to go to leave the scores tied.
However, Burns, who had already missed one drop-goal attempt, split the posts from the tee to send Tigers up to fourth in the table, seven points above their fifth-placed local rivals.
Leicester Tigers director of rugby Richard Cockerill:
""Credit to them for getting back into it, but credit to our players for the first 30 minutes and then for digging themselves out of a hole they probably shouldn't have got themselves into.

296,"Watson, who climbs to a career-high 38th in the world rankings, is the first British woman since Anne Hobbs in 1985 to win a second tour title.
The 22-year-old from Guernsey did not drop a set throughout the week.
She now heads to the Australian Open, where she will play Bulgaria's Tsvetana Pironkova in round one on Tuesday.
Watson won her first WTA title in Osaka two years ago, before her career was interrupted by illness.
She began last year ranked 119th in the world following a bout of glandular fever but has since recovered and begun working with Argentine coach Diego Veronelli.
Victory in Hobart means Watson moved 11 places up the world rankings.
""Thanks to my coach Diego. It's been great working with you,"" she said afterwards.
""We work really hard but we also have fun.""
Brengle, the world number 84, was a surprise finalist having come through qualifying, but the 24-year-old made the early running in the final.
After a rain-interrupted semi-final there was another early shower on Saturday, and Watson then survived a 14-minute opening service game that included six break points.
The service struggles continued in the wind and Watson twice fell a break behind but was able to hit back immediately each time, levelling at 3-3 after a scrappy 44 minutes.
Watson then made the decisive move as she reeled off three games to take the set, and after a steadier start to the second she went ahead again at 4-3.
There was a hint of nerves when she slipped 15-30 behind while serving for the match, but Watson closed out the win and headed to the stands to hug coach Veronelli.
""When I won Osaka in 2012, it was more of a surprise,"" said Watson. ""But here, I feel like I belong.
""I'm obviously very happy. It was tough conditions again today, very windy, and I knew Madison would be tough - we know each other very well on and off the court, and we practise a lot in Florida.
""It really was my toughest match of the week. I was happy I stayed mentally strong and managed to get ahead and hold my nerve at the end.""",British number one Heather Watson beat American qualifier Madison Brengle in straight sets to win her second WTA title at the Hobart International.
297,"More than 7,000 children and adolescents had their mental health referrals rejected last year.
The Scottish Association for Mental Health (SAMH) described the figure as ""astonishing"".
The Scottish government has already said it will commission a review into rejected referrals.
But SAMH said the issue needed to be addressed as quickly as possible because young people were ""waiting now to get help and support"".
The charity's Jo Anderson said 17,500 people had been turned away from receiving Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) support over the past three years.
She added: ""That's an astonishing figure, and we don't know what happens to them after they've been turned away. We don't know whether they received any other support.
""In the last few weeks of the campaign we've been running, we've been inundated with calls from parents who're in that situation and their child has been rejected from receiving a CAMHS service.
""They haven't been signposted anywhere else - that's a very worrying picture.""
Caitlin Wyllie-Quinn, 20, a student from Irvine, had a difficult transition to secondary school.
Bullying left her isolated and very down, crying all the time.
She got some initial help from the local Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service but after leaving therapy she went downhill rapidly.
Her GP made another referral to CAMHS but this time it was rejected. Caitlin was told that because she was not suicidal or self-harming, her case was not serious enough.
""If the person doing the assessment had asked me if I was suicidal or self-harming I would have answered yes to both those questions, but basically I was refused help because they didn't have the capability to assess me properly,"" she said.
""I was at a real low point and I felt that getting referred to CAMHS was some sort of light at the end of the tunnel and finally maybe getting some help.
""For that to be stripped away from me made me feel even more worthless and just made things so much worse for me.""
The NHS in Scotland provides mental health services for children and young people with a wide range of mental health problems including anxiety, behaviour problems, depression and early onset psychosis.
The Scottish government's mental health strategy commits it to carrying out reviews into school counselling and rejected child and adolescent mental health service referrals.
Its mental health minister, Maureen Watt, said the reviews would happen ""soon"", and would allow improvements to be made to the system.
Ms Anderson said this was encouraging, but added: ""We really urge that to be quick and thorough because there are young people waiting now to get help and support.
""It might be that the CAMHS service isn't appropriate for them, but we simply don't know what the problem is.""
Meanwhile, statistics published on Tuesday also showed that a waiting time target for people to receive specialist mental health treatment has again been missed.
The Scottish government has had a target in place since 2014 for 90% of patients to be seen within 18 weeks of referral for mental health support.
But the target has never been met nationally - with the latest figures showing that 83.6% of children and adolescents, and 73.7% of adults, were seen within the required timescale between January and March of this year.
At the end of March, there were 6,932 children and young people across Scotland waiting for help from CAMHS, up from 6,359 at the end of December, according to the NHS statistics.
At the same time, there were 20,952 adults waiting for treatment, compared to 20,195 in December.
Average waiting times varied dramatically across the country, with 10 NHS boards meeting the target for CAMHS treatment but only three health boards meeting it for adult psychological care.
The figures also showed that 74 children and young people starting their treatment had been waiting more than a year to be seen.
NHS Grampian met the waiting time target for just 45.2% of young people, while in NHS Lothian the target was met for 47.8% of youngsters
And in the NHS Forth Valley area, only 40% of adults starting psychological treatment between January and March were seen within 18 weeks, with an average wait of 25 weeks.
A spokesman for the Scottish Children's Services Coalition (SCSC) said research has suggested 10% of children aged between five and 16 have a clinically diagnosable mental health problem.
Pointing to a ""clear postcode lottery"" when it comes to treatment, he added: ""We are deeply concerned about what is happening to the more than a fifth of children and young people not accepted for treatment.
""There is a need for an urgent inquiry to ascertain why these young people are being rejected for treatment and what is happening to them.""
Ms Watt, the mental health minster, said the number of health boards which had met the waiting time target for young people had increased from seven to 10 since the end of 2016.
She added: ""However, I'm clear that we must continue to reduce waiting times and I will not be satisfied until our target is met sustainably.
""Our recently published 10-year strategy for mental health sets out a range of measures that focus on prevention and early intervention to meet the mental health needs of children and young people, backed by Â£150m of funding.
""We will also soon commission reviews into school counselling and rejected child and adolescent mental health service referrals, as a foundation for making further improvements.""",Mental health campaigners have called for an urgent review into why so many young people in Scotland are being turned down for specialist treatment.
298,"Kromtech - the Germany-based firm behind MacKeeper - has acknowledged that its customers' names, internet addresses and login credentials were among the data  exposed.
However, it said that users' payment details were ""never at risk"".
The firm believes the details were accessed only by the security expert who alerted it to the problem.
""The privacy and security of our clients' information remains our top priority and from the moment we were aware of the access, we immediately took several proactive steps to identify and correct the issue,"" it said in a statement.
""We want to offer a special 'thank you' to security researcher Chris Vickery for identifying the security breach attempt so that we could stop it before anyone was harmed.""
Mr Vickery told security blogger Brian Krebs that he had discovered 21 gigabytes of MacKeeper user data ""after spending a few bored moments searching for database servers"" that were not password-protected. He was able to do this by using Shodan, a search engine for internet-connected devices.
Mr Krebs reported that Kromtech initially said that 13 million customers' details had been exposed.
That figure was removed from the firm's statement - a spokesman for Kromtech told the BBC it had included both ""active and non-active"" users.
MacKeeper is widely promoted on the web - including in prominent adverts on Ookla's Speedtest site - as a way to ""clean"" and ""protect"" Macintosh computers in order to help them run faster.
However, critics have claimed that the software can cause computers to slow down and crash, and can be problematic to remove.

The former Wham! star said the channel had been ""insensitive, contemptuous and reprehensible"" and should have waited until after his friend's funeral.
But Channel 5 said it was ""a measured account"" of Michael's life and death.
""George Michael was a high-profile public figure and there has been legitimate public interest in the circumstances surrounding his death,"" the broadcaster said in a statement.
It said the documentary, which aired at 21:00 GMT on Thursday, had been ""based on contributions from those who knew him and reported on him over many decades"".
Ridgeley, who paid an emotional tribute to Michael at last month's Brit Awards, had called the programme a ""piece of voyeurism"" that should only have been aired ""after a respectful period"".
It was confirmed earlier this month that Michael - who was born Georgios Kyriacos Panayiotou - died on Christmas Day as a result of heart and liver disease.

She added: ""We have therefore suspended Councillor Frost from the Conservative Group pending investigation.""

303,"Current drugs help manage the symptoms, but do not prevent brain cells dying.
The trial on 62 patients, published in the Lancet, hints the medicine halted the progression of the disease.
The University College London (UCL) team is ""excited"", but it urges caution as any long-term benefit is uncertain and the drug needs more testing.
""There's absolutely no doubt the most important unmet need in Parkinson's is a drug to slow down disease progression, it's unarguable,"" Prof Tom Foltynie, one of the researchers, told the BBC.
In Parkinson's, the brain is progressively damaged and the cells that produce the hormone dopamine are lost.
It leads to a tremor, difficulty moving and eventually memory problems.
Therapies help manage symptoms by boosting dopamine levels, but the death of the brain continues and the disease gets worse.
No drug stops that happening.
In the trial, half of patients were given the diabetes drug exenatide and the rest were given a placebo (dummy treatment). All the patients stayed on their usual medication.
As expected, those on just their usual medication declined over 48 weeks of treatment. But those given exenatide were stable.
And three months after the experimental treatment stopped, those who had been taking exenatide were still better off.
Prof Foltynie told the BBC News website: ""This is the first clinical trial in actual patients with Parkinson's where there has been anything like this size of effect.
""It gives us confidence exenatide is not just masking symptoms, it's doing something to the underlying disease.
""We have to be excited and encouraged, but also cautious as we need to replicate these findings.""
They also need to trial the drug for much longer periods of time.
An effective drug would need to hold back the disease for years in order to make a significant difference to patients.
Parkinson's progresses slowly and the difference in this 60-week trial was definitely there, but was ""trivial"" in terms of the impact on day-to-day life, say the researchers.
The drug helps control blood sugar levels in diabetes by acting on a hormone sensor called GLP-1.
Those sensors are found in brain cells too. It is thought the drug makes those cells work more efficiently or helps them to survive.
It is why the drug is being tested in other neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's.
David Dexter, the deputy director of research at Parkinson's UK, said: ""The findings offer hope that drugs like exenatide can slow the course of Parkinson's - â€Šsomething no current treatment can do.
""Because Parkinson's can progress quite gradually, this study was probably too small and short to tell us whether exenatide can halt the progression of the condition, but it's certainly encouraging and warrants further investigation.""
Dr Brian Fiske, from the The Michael J Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research, said: ""The results from the exenatide studies justify continued testing, but clinicians and patients are urged not to add exenatide to their regimens until more is known about their safety and impact on Parkinson's.""","It may be possible to stop the progression of Parkinson's disease with a drug normally used in type 2 diabetes, a clinical trial suggests."
304,"Shadow Europe minister Pat Glass made the comments after an interview with BBC Radio Derby in Sawley, Derbyshire.
She said: ""The very first person I come to is a horrible racist. I'm never coming back to wherever this is.""
She later said the comments were ""inappropriate"" but UKIP said it showed ""contempt"" for people's concerns.
Updates on this story and more from Derbyshire
The man Ms Glass is believed to have been referring to said he had spoken to her about to a Polish family in the area who he believed were living on benefits, describing them as ""spongers"", but denied being racist.
The North West Durham MP said: ""The comments I made were inappropriate and I regret them.
""Concerns about immigration are entirely valid and it's important that politicians engage with them.
""I apologise to the people living in Sawley for any offence I have caused.""
But those campaigning for the UK to leave the EU criticised her remarks.
Conservative MP Peter Bone, one of the founders of Grassroots Out, said: ""It is disappointing that a member of the Remain campaign called a voter a 'horrible racist' for raising perfectly valid concerns about the impact uncontrolled migration is having on the UK.""
And Steven Woolfe MEP, UKIP's migration spokesman, said her comments showed ""the contempt Labour has for ordinary workers' concerns"".
""It is in the DNA of the Labour Party. We have had Gordon Brown calling a Labour supporter a bigot, Emily Thornberry ridiculing a white van man displaying an English flag - and now this.""
Brendan Chilton, the general secretary of the Labour group campaigning for Brexit - Labour Leave - criticised Ms Glass's comments as ""shocking"". ""A significant number of Labour voters want to leave the EU, and have justified concerns with immigration.
""Pat Glass's comments do not reflect the views of a large number of Labour voters.""
Conservative MP for Erewash Maggie Throup had urged Ms Glass ""to make a full apology to my constituent at the earliest opportunity"" and to return to the area ""to see for herself just how great a place it is to live, work and raise a family"".
In April 2010, then PM Gordon Brown apologised after being recorded describing a 65-year-old voter as a ""bigoted woman"".

Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper, who is campaigning for the UK to remain in the EU, told BBC One's Question Time: ""Pat has apologised and of course it's not racist to want to leave the European Union, it's not racist to be worried about immigration - there are concerns particularly about dodgy employers who exploit low skilled migration to undercut wages and jobs and I think something should be done about that.""

305,"In the other group, qualification will go down to the final day of matches, after bottom side Al Ahly finally recorded a win - beating leaders Wydad Casablanca 1-0.
Zambia's Zesco are tied with Wydad after being held 1-1 by Asec Mimosas of Ivory Coast, who have the same number of points as Ahly.
The loss led to the resignation of Zamalek coach Mohamed Helmi, while captain Hazem Emam has been suspended over an altercation with a team member.
Zamalek chairman accepted Helmi's resignation and has appointed Mohamed Salah  as interim coach.
An own-goal from Zamalek's Ali Gabr in the 79th minute secured Sundowns' qualification to complete a remarkable turnaround for the South Africans in the Champions League.
Sundowns had been eliminated in the final qualifying round for the Champions League last April by AS Vita Club from the Democratic Republic of Congo.
Demoted to the second-tier Confederation Cup, Sundowns were beaten by Medeama of Ghana in a play-off to suffer further African disappointment.
But on the eve of the June draw for the Champions League groups, the organisers kicked out Vita Club for using a banned player and Sundowns were reinstated.
The victory over Zamalek puts Sundowns top of Group B on nine points - six ahead of Zamalek in second.
We still have to do the business
""The gap is getting closer and closer between us and the north Africans,"" Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane said after the win.
But he cautioned that Sundowns' hard work could come to nothing if they fail to win the title.
""There's a little bit of bragging rights in beating Zamalek, but we still have to do the business,"" he said.
Bottom side Enyimba of Nigeria are yet to register a point after two matches in this group which is reduced to three teams following Entente Setif's disqualification.
Enyimba and Zamalek play in the final round of group matches to decide which of them will join Sundowns in the last four.
In Group A, Wydad Casablanca of Morocco and Zesco United of Zambia also had the chance to secure semi-finals places if they both won their matches on Wednesday.
However, Zesco United were held to a draw away to Asec Mimosas in Abidjan to open up the group and keep ASEC's faint hopes of progressing alive.
Asec piled on the pressure on Zesco with a 75th minute strike from Nabi Kone, but the visitors responded five minutes later with an equaliser from Jackson Mwanza.
The result left Zesco level on seven points with leaders  Wydad Casablanca who were beaten at home by bottom-of-the-table Al Ahly of Egypt in the late match.
Asec are a further three points behind.
Ahly had managed just one point from their first three games but Rami Rabia's goal early in the second half in Morocco gave them a fine away win.

307,"But six years after he stepped down, the public response to news that he has now been freed from detention has been remarkably quiet.
Earlier this month, a top appeals court cleared Mubarak of involvement in killing some of the 900 protesters who died during the country's uprising.
Egypt's prosecutor ruled there was no reason to hold him, as he had already served a three-year sentence for embezzling public funds.
After the first legal decision, the ex-president gave a rare telephone interview to an Egyptian journalist, who offered her congratulations.
He told her that, at the age of 88, he was ""in good health"" and would be ""staying at home"" in his family's property in Heliopolis, eastern Cairo.
A former general, Mubarak was one of the Arab world's most well known leaders.  A close ally of the United States, he long kept an iron grip on power, despite claims of corruption and cronyism.
Recently, as Egypt has gone through waves of political and economic upheaval, many have come to look back at the Mubarak era as a time of relative calm and prosperity.
Karim Hussein set up a Facebook page called ""We're Sorry Mr President,"" which has more than 1.8m likes.
""It was my greatest wish in life to see President Mubarak finish with his legal case,"" says Mr Hussein, who visited the former leader in the military hospital where he spent most of his time in custody.
""I knew he was innocent from day one, because a man who once fought for the freedom of this country, would never kill its youth,"" he goes on.
""We won in the end.  It's a great victory for a great man.""
The first elected successor to President Mubarak was an Islamist, Mohammed Morsi, who was then overthrown in mass protests.
Seeking stability, Egyptians next voted in Abdul Fattah al-Sisi, another military strongman, who has led a crackdown on Islamists and pro-democracy activists.
Tens of thousands of people have been detained.
""I think we've gone a complete cycle around,"" says journalist, Shahira Amin, who rose to prominence when she resigned from state TV over its coverage of the 2011 uprising.
She has since been tried and acquitted of charges of posing a threat to national security.
Ms Amin is unsurprised by Mubarak's release or the muted reaction to it.
""Most Egyptians are just busy trying to make ends meet with the economic pressures: soaring prices, inflation, unemployment,"" Ms Amin says.
""The activists who started this revolution, many of them are behind bars.  People have been silenced or intimidated and there are no more outspoken critics of the government. ""
For those who made sacrifices in Tahrir Square, the crucible of Egypt's popular revolt, the fact that Mubarak is now free, while so many protesters remain in jail, is hard to bear.
It raises questions about whether any of their calls for reforms and freedom were ever really answered.
""His release is a sign of the corruption in the country,"" comments Randa Sami, who worked as a nurse at a field hospital in 2011.
She has life-long injuries and can only walk with crutches after police beat her.
""I put up a Facebook post saying: ""Oh God where are my rights, the rights of those killed and injured?"" Many people sympathised,"" she says.
However, she insists she has no regrets.
""It was worth it to go to the streets,"" she reflects.  ""Ok, Mubarak was not fully punished for his deeds but he was the first president to go to jail.""
""At least we got him to go through this.""","In 2011, millions of Egyptians took to the streets demanding the removal of their autocratic president of 30 years, Hosni Mubarak."

A deal appeared to have been struck following further talks with the company.
Members of the GMB union, which has 1,200 members working with Diageo in Scotland, voted by almost 3-1 in favour of accepting the deal.
But Unite members rejected it by a margin of 62% to 38%.

Unite, which has more than 700 members at Diageo sites around the UK, has yet to comment on the the outcome of its ballot.
However, it is understood union officials will be speaking to Unite representatives at Diageo in the coming days.
The GMB union's Scotland organiser, Louise Gilmour said: ""After a long campaign our members have voted strongly to accept this deal which means they will continue to have a pension scheme that ranks among the very best in the UK private sector.
""We will now sit down with Diageo and talk about the future to ensure the interests of our members are at the very heart of this hugely profitable global company that is so vital to the Scottish economy.""
In a statement, the company said it was committed to ""providing competitive and sustainable pensions"".
It said: ""In the last decade we have invested an additional Â£1.1bn into the final salary scheme over and above our normal employer contributions.

Many others have had their outcomes improved by having the intervention.
Dr Rachel Hawes, who is also a doctor on the air ambulance, used her experiences as officer in the Army Reserve - including deployment in Afghanistan - as the basis for the idea for the scheme.
She said: ""About half of people with traumatic injuries who die, die from bleeding.
""Previously, stopping the bleeding could only be done in hospital, but one of the ways to buy yourself time is to replace the blood they're losing.""
Volunteers from Cumbria and Northumbria Blood Bikes deliver the blood in cool boxes to the helicopters daily.
Of those receiving transfusion, 83% were injured as a result of road traffic accidents, and the rest by incidents involving crushing and assaults, or heavy falls.

312,"After Brexit, that would obviously exclude London where the vast majority is currently done.
That has always been a major grievance for other European capitals who sense an opportunity to restart an old fight for a big prize.
London's financial district - or ""The City"" - is like a coral reef. It has grown into a complex ecosystem over hundreds of years with lots of specialist organisms feeding off each other.
The coral is home to plants and anemones which in turn are home to fish, and crustacea of dazzling variety.
Bankers and traders may be the apex predators but there are lawyers, accountants, insurance brokers and tech workers swimming around them.
It's very hard to replicate but that doesn't mean it can't be damaged. If you chip a bit off - you lose a few of the resident clownfish too.
That rather extended metaphor is perhaps one way to think about the subject of euro clearing. It's a very basic, boring and yet incredibly important bit of the reef.
Clearing is the process by which a third party organisation acts as an intermediary for both buyer and seller.
They deal with the clearing ""house"" rather than each other which centralises everything and makes the whole complex business easier and quicker. 75% of all everything bought and sold in euros - anywhere in the world - is cleared in London - some 850 billion euros EVERY DAY.
Clearing houses also bear the risks that once side of the transaction doesn't cough up.
In return for that risk, buyers and sellers have to keep money in a special account with the clearing house in case there are problems. The more business you do with them, the less money proportionately of your trading volumes you need to keep in that account. Bigger clearing houses are therefore cheaper for their customers.
If you start chipping bits off the reef and carting them off to Europe those costs could rise. Some estimates put the cost of fragmenting this bit of the reef at an additional 77bn euros to the people that use them.
It would cost UK jobs too. An Ernst and Young study last year estimated that over 80,000 UK jobs would go if euro-clearing moved from London.
Other financial centres have tried for years to steal this business. In fact, the European Central Bank in Frankfurt tried to insist that all euro trades in the EU were done inside the eurozone. A policy it had to scrap when the European Court of Justice ruled in 2015 it discriminated against non-eurozone countries who are part of the EU.
If that court case is run again once the UK is outside the EU, that defence no longer works.
This new raiding party is led by the EU Financial Services Commissioner Valdis Dombrovkis who is arguing that either the EU has greater policing powers over clearing in London (a cup of cold sick in political and regulatory terms) or, the business has to relocate to the EU (two cups).
It's not clear, however, that a defeat for London would be a victory for the EU. Some euro clearing also happens in the US and many think that the way firms will minimise the cost of disruption and fragmentation will be to do their business in New York - another big reef - which would only serve to weaken Europe as a whole in the global financial power league.
That is what Chancellor Philip Hammond was getting at when he warned that the UK and Europe ""should be careful of any proposals which might disrupt growth, raise the cost of investment in Europe and the UK or weaken financial stability"".

Ofsted found no children ""inadequately protected or at risk of significant harm"" and praised ""rapid improvements"".
Service director Sue Westcott said there was ""no room for complacency"".
The Conservative-led council had been subject to an Ofsted ""notice to improve"" since June 2010, following an inspection in March of that year.
A re-inspection of children's services in August 2011 again found the overall effectiveness of the department to be inadequate.
The review of the Tyler Whelan case, published in May last year, found it was one of many agencies that missed ""numerous opportunities"" for ""more rigorous and incisive"" interventions.
Elvis Lee, 34, kicked and bit Tyler Whelan, who died in hospital after collapsing at his home in Sheepwalk, Paston, near Peterborough.
The new rating of adequate by the education standards authority means the service ""meets minimum requirements"".
It follows an eight-day unannounced inspection of the department by five Ofsted officers in January.
""They found the lessons of the past had been taken very seriously and [the council] had invested considerably in additional social workers,"" Mrs Westcott said.
Investing in more staff meant the use of agency workers had been reduced and social workers' caseloads were now ""more manageable"", she added.
Nick Sandford, leader of the Liberal Democrat group on the city council, said: ""There were some really important issues surrounding child safety but the council has recognised those significant failures and addressed them.""
He described the improvements as ""encouraging"" but questioned whether the council could maintain the required level of investment.
Earlier this week city councillors agreed ??17m worth of cuts, including to children's play centres and adult social care services.
Mrs Westcott said: ""The money that's been invested [in children's services] has been absolutely worthwhile.""
Services are rated by Ofsted as inadequate, adequate, good or outstanding.","Children's services at Peterborough City Council have been rated as adequate by Ofsted, after two consecutive years of ""poor"" ratings."

316,"The personal tale came a week after Labour MP Jon Ashworth spoke in parliament about his experience of having an alcoholic father.
The NSPCC says it receives a call every hour from an adult concerned about drug or alcohol use around children, and it believes up to a million young people could be living with an alcoholic or drug dependent parent.
So how does it feel to grow up with an addicted parent? And what impact does it have beyond childhood?
Three people shared their stories with the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme.
Josh Connolly was nine when his father, an alcoholic, died.
Now 29, he says the experience left him full of anger, which he would often direct at other people, feeling shame at his father's behaviour but guilt for not standing by him.
""I tend to only remember a lot of the bad things and also the feelings,"" he said.
""That is what stayed with me through my life and is still tangible today; the way that my dad's drinking and everything that comes with that made me feel.""
Josh's experience led him to develop his own problems with drinking during his teenage years.
""I desperately wanted more than anything else in my life not to be an alcoholic, but when I was 12 or 13 and found alcohol, it just became the perfect escape route for me.
""I was never really able to look after my dad. At school I acted the clown, at home I am trying to be the best possible me that I could be, so alcohol gave me an escape from that.""
Jade Bailey's father was a heroin addict who took drugs around her from as far back as she could remember.
He began with cannabis and ecstasy, taking it with friends and telling his daughter it was ""medicine.""
But as she got older, he moved onto harder drugs.
""I knew it was never right and never their medicine,"" said the 25-year-old.
""I remember them going into the bathroom, I can even picture it now, and doing it, coming out and all being off their faces.
""When he went on to heroin, I was about ten years old and he was a mess. Our fun time on the weekend was going to the skip and trying to find toys.
""At that age, I thought it was amazing as my dad was always my hero.""
When Jade told her mother what had been happening when she went to visit, she stopped her from going and only let Jade contact her father by phone.
""I have never had that answer from him of why wasn't I enough to make [him] stop,"" she said. ""Why do you not love me enough to stop and be my dad?
""He knew how much I adored him and I knew he adored me, I knew I was the only thing he cared about, apart from the drug.
""It makes you feel very alone and abandoned by them, but you love them so much you can't ever leave them, no matter what they do.""
Sarah was brought up by her father, who is an alcoholic.
She said the drinking changed her relationship with him so much she had to walk away.
""In my early years, it was happy,"" she said. ""It made it harder when he turned to alcohol because I couldn't understand and it made it harder to walk away.
""I missed the old dad he was and always wished I could have the old dad back.""
Sarah never told anyone about his problem so had to deal with it alone.
She thinks the experience made her ""stronger, braver and more resilient to life's challenges"", but it affected her attitude towards alcohol.
""I always feel anxious when I am around drunk people,"" she said.
""It reminds me of the time I was looking after my dad, the feelings I got from that and the embarrassment, shame and sadness.""","Accepting a Bafta award for leading actor, Manchester by the Sea star Casey Affleck revealed to the audience he had grown up with an alcoholic parent."

The Black Cats' 10-season spell in the top flight ended when they lost 1-0 at home to Bournemouth on Saturday and Hull City drew 0-0 at Southampton.
Moyes, who took charge at Sunderland in July last year, has faced calls from supporters to step down.
""I think it's a question for two or three weeks' time,"" said the Scot.
""I think we all need to reflect and look at everything from top to bottom.""
Chairman Ellis Short, who has been trying to sell the club, apologised to Sunderland fans, and admitted mistakes had been made.
Since Short bought the club in 2009 - he became chairman in 2011 - the Black Cats have had seven full-time managers, but have faced the threat of relegation in almost every season.
""We need to improve both on and off the field, and despite the bitter disappointment there is a strong determination to do so throughout the club,"" said the American.
""There is significant work to be done over the summer and when the season is concluded, we intend to share our plans to move forward with our supporters.""
Listen as fans react to Sunderland's relegation on 606
This is the first time Moyes has been relegated as a manager, and he warned fans just two games into the the season that he thought they would struggle.
""I feel for the supporters because they're the people who pay their hard-earned cash to come and watch and we've not given them enough this season,"" said the former Everton and Manchester United manager.
""I've had 400-odd games in the Premier League and I've got an idea of what a good squad looks like.
""My feeling at the start of the season was it was going to be a hard graft, and I'd rather be up front with people than tell them something different.""
The defeat by Bournemouth was the ninth time Sunderland have failed to score in their past 10 games, and the 18th time they have failed to do so this season.
Jermain Defoe, the team's top scorer this season with 14, has not found the net in more than 15 hours of Premier League football.
""We've needed Jermain's goals,"" said Moyes.
""At times we haven't given him enough quality supply. But there has been other times, like today, when a couple of chances came. In the early part of the season he was getting them and finishing them.""
Moyes was given the Sunderland job after Sam Allardyce  left for his brief stint as England manager.
He has not been helped by injuries, with Jan Kirchhoff, Lee Cattermole, Duncan Watmore, Jordan Pickford, Paddy McNair and Victor Anichebe among the first-team players to have had lengthy spells on the sidelines.
Short said: ""I acknowledge that during my ownership mistakes have been made, particularly in the area of player recruitment, and as a result we have found ourselves struggling to survive in recent seasons.
""We had massive disruption during the summer transfer window, and an unprecedented number of injuries throughout the season.
""These are difficulties which we have been unable to overcome and we are paying the price for that now.""

Match of the Day pundit and former Newcastle striker Alan Shearer:
David Moyes has got to take responsibility as has the owner. It's been a disastrous season from start to finish. Mismanagement at all levels and they've signed some poor players. They've been flirting with relegations for a number of seasons and it was inevitable it was going to happen.
A £28m net spend in the last three transfer windows is comparable with teams in and around them, but I worry for Sunderland. There are two players that are assets in that team [Jordan Pickford and Jermain Defoe]. Other than that there's not too much in that squad that's worth a lot of money.
Match of the Day commentator John Motson:
A club badly managed from above for the last four years. At least three managers have got them out of it at the end of the season.
The rot set in at Sunderland a long time ago and it came right from the top.
I have no sympathy with them - they deserved to do down. I just hope somebody, whether it's David Moyes - a new owner perhaps - has got the opportunity to bring them back.
They have been a great club, they've got great fans but I'm afraid the way the club has been run, they've deserved what they got.
Former Premier League striker Jason Roberts:
Those Sunderland fans are seeing a team and a club that I think has lacked leadership from the boardroom.
That's why they have skipped from manager to manager with no real plan or identity.

321,"The largest shareholder in Hafren Power has previously been declared bankrupt three times during a lengthy business career.
Another businessman has been declared bankrupt twice but said it should not detract from the project's legitimacy.
Backers claim the £25bn barrage could generate 5% of Britain's electricity.
Hafren Power wants to build an 11 mile (17.7km) barrage between Lavernock Point near Penarth, Vale of Glamorgan, and Brean near Weston-super-Mare, Somerset.
Richard Bazley - the largest shareholder in Hafren Power - was declared bankrupt in 1977, 1994 and 2005.
Mr Bazley, described by Hafren Power as its founder and ""the visionary"" behind the barrage, describes himself as a ""serial entrepreneur"".
He declined to be interviewed but Hafren Power chief executive Tony Pryor denied Mr Bazley's background undermined the credibility of the project.
Another founder Idwal Stedman, who sits on Hafren Power's regional committee, has been declared bankrupt twice: in 1994 while working as an architect and in 2006 while working as an antiques dealer.
Although Hafren Power describes Mr Stedman as having run ""a highly regarded architecture firm,"" he is currently barred from calling himself an architect.
He was struck off by the Architects Registration Board last year after complaints about unpaid bills.
The board removed him from the register for ""conduct that is fundamentally incompatible with continuing to be an architect"".
Mr Stedman has also been the subject of seven separate county court judgements totalling more than £20,000 between 2009 and 2011.
He told BBC Wales in a statement: ""Richard Bazley and I originated the idea of a privately funded barrage seven years ago and have worked tirelessly since because we recognised the enormous value of the economic regeneration and clean energy. Without us, there would be no proposal.
""Today the project is maturing and growing, led by a new team of outside business talent. We are still involved and are shareholders.
""Past bankruptcies or mistakes, unconnected to the project, are of course painful for everyone involved. But they should not detract from the legitimacy of the barrage and its importance to Wales and the West of England.""
Supporters of the barrage say the privately-financed project could generate up to 5% of Britain's energy needs by using more than 1,000 turbines and tidal power.
But the project cannot go ahead without UK government support. Ministers say they want to see more detailed proposals before they allocate parliamentary time for a bill to allow the project to go ahead.
Neath Labour MP Peter Hain resigned from the shadow cabinet to campaign for the barrage. He declined to comment.
Supporters say the scheme would be financed by sovereign wealth funds and not require taxpayers' cash.
A similar project was rejected by the UK government in 2010 on grounds of cost, but Hafren Power says the revised barrage would overcome that issue and also be more environmentally friendly.

323,"Since 2005, he has worked from home on Wednesday mornings and then taken the rest of the day off.
Simmons and Simmons offers flexible working to all staff and makes this clear in recruitment ads.
It is a stance employers' organisation the CBI wants other firms to emulate, arguing it will improve diversity.
In a report aimed at encouraging employers to hire a broader range of people from varied social backgrounds, age groups, races and gender the CBI suggests advertising flexible working at the outset.
Just one in ten job adverts mention flexible working, despite more than half of employers offering it, meaning they miss out on a wider pool of applicants, according to the report.
The CBI also suggests that firms remove candidates' names from job applications in a bid to reduce ""unconscious bias"" in hiring decisions.
The organisation argues that firms with a broader pool of staff will perform better.
CBI president Paul Drechsler says: ""Inclusive workplaces give firms the chance to get ahead of their competitors by making better decisions, through diverse teams which draw on a wider range of ideas and experiences.""
Since 2014, Simmons & Simmons has allowed almost all its staff to work remotely one day a week of their choice without having to request permission from their boss.
It says the move was aimed at making ""flexible working a right rather than an exception"" and has seen a ""significant increase"" in the number of people who have taken up flexible working.
Mr Taylor says in 2005 when he asked to work flexibly it was ""quite unusual"", but said he was granted permission in just three weeks. Being at home one day a week has enabled him to spend more time with his three children now aged 14, 12 and 9.
""At the time [when I asked] I was a relatively new partner and also a relatively new dad and had two young children and was worried i was not seeing a huge amount of them during the week.""
Now the children are older, he says he can pick them up from school as well as drop them off at activities. ""I haven't done anything particularly dramatic with the time, but it's nice to be there day-to-day and talk about what's going on at school.""
The change has also enabled Mr Taylor's partner to work later on a Wednesday, helping her progress at work, as well as make him feel loyal to the firm.
It is these sorts of factors that the CBI wants companies to be aware of. Mr Drechsler argues that flexible working should no longer be seen as ""a bonus for staff"", but instead as something that also has clear benefits for employers.
Other recommendations in the report include:
The report said data from earlier this month showing the UK's productivity still lags well behind other major economies meant employing a broader range of people was now more crucial than ever, and would help create more engaged employees.
""The economic and social challenges that the UK faces have been thrown into sharp relief by Brexit, in particular around issues like productivity, inclusion and opportunity,"" Mr Drechsler says.
""As businesses, it is up to us to seize the opportunities that exist to make some positive changes, becoming firms that will be competitive into the middle of the 21st century. If we get it right, business growth and greater opportunity will go hand in hand.""","""I didn't want to be a weekend dad,"" is how Julian Taylor, partner at law firm Simmons and Simmons, explains what drove him to ask for flexible working."
324,"A proposed scheme would have scrapped upfront relief, worth an estimated £21bn to savers, but made pension pot withdrawals tax free.
An alternative option was to set a flat rate of tax relief, which may have been unpopular with higher earners.
Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell said Mr Osborne was ""yet again ducking a big decision"".
Campaigners said he had missed a ""huge opportunity"" to tackle pension inequality and help the lower paid.
But others said he was right to protect existing reliefs, and that radical reforms would have created new risks and imposed new administrative burdens on employers.
Mr Osborne had been expected to unveil changes in the Budget on 16 March, but a Treasury source said it was ""not the right time"" to make changes to pension tax relief.
The relief allows some of a person's earnings that would have been taken by government in tax to go into their pension instead.
Under the current system, pension savers receive tax relief at the same rate as their income tax - meaning basic rate taxpayers receive relief at 20% and higher rate taxpayers at 40 or 45%.
The proposal to introduce arrangements similar to an Isa, with no tax relief on contributions but with withdrawals free of tax, would have given a significant short-term boost to the government at the expense of lower tax revenue later.
An alternative option considered by the Treasury was for flat rate relief, which would have benefited basic rate taxpayers and cut reliefs for higher earners.
BBC business correspondent Joe Lynam
So a policy which hadn't been announced will now not be announced.
And the big winners of this non-announcement will be wealthy people. At the moment not only do they earn more, they also get a proportionately bigger tax top-up from the government when they save for their retirement.
If the chancellor had scrapped the tax relief entirely on pensions savings and created instead a new pensions Isa, that would have cost the better off (40p and 45p taxpayers) billions of pounds collectively.
The other proposal which had been reported was to create a new pension tax relief rate of 25p or even 33p. That would have punished higher earners as well but not by as much as the Isa-style option.
It would also have encouraged saving for retirement by the less well off (20p taxpayers) by, in effect, giving a pound for every four they saved.
Mick McAteer, co-director of the Financial Inclusion Centre, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he was ""very disappointed"" that the government had stepped away from tackling the ""clear inequality in our pension system"".
Dot Gibson, general secretary of the National Pensioners Convention, Britain's biggest pensioner organisation, said: ""The chancellor has wasted a golden opportunity to not only reform the unfair system of pension tax relief, but at the same time solve the funding crisis in social care.""
Conservative MP Mark Garnier, who sits on the Treasury select committee, acknowledged that the present system ""massively favours those people who are earning more money"" and told Today he favoured ""a fundamental rehash of the pension system"".
However, he said a flat rate relief would have been ""quite difficult to administer"" and more thought should be given to what reforms would work best.
Mr McDonnell said the chancellor was ""putting the interests of his party ahead of those of our country"".
""The big test for this Budget is whether it can start to lay the secure foundations for the economy of the future. This decision suggests George Osborne is only interested in securing the future leadership of his party.""
Former Liberal Democrat pensions minister Steve Webb, who now works in the pensions industry, said Mr Osborne had been right to resist changes.
He called for a ""period of stability"" in pensions policy in the interest of encouraging people to save for the long term.
Savers pay no tax on money they put into a pension but they do pay tax on what they take out each year beyond the personal allowance.
The government also allows pensioners to withdraw 25% of their pot tax free as a lump sum.
The way the relief works is that some of a person's earnings that would have been taken by government in tax can be contributed to their pension instead.
Pension savers receive tax relief at the highest rate of income tax they pay.
This means that the cost of a £10,000 pension contribution would, in effect, be £8,000 for a basic rate taxpayer because otherwise £2,000 would have gone in tax. For a 40% taxpayer the saving would be £4,000, and £4,500 for those at the 45% rate. So present arrangements favour the better off.
The amount anyone can save into a pension and receive tax relief on is capped at £40,000 annually and £1.25m in their lifetime.
Mr Osborne was warned ahead of the Budget that introducing Isa-style arrangements could prompt a mass withdrawal from pension funds.
Conservative MPs had also become concerned about the impact on their constituents of any move to flat rate relief, which would have reduced breaks for higher rate taxpayers.
BBC political correspondent Eleanor Garnier said Mr Osborne's decision was also a recognition of how fragile the EU referendum campaign is and removed the risk of upsetting voters ahead of the vote on 23 June.
An ally of the chancellor told the Times that Mr Osborne did not want to put people off saving. ""Now isn't the right time, with uncertainty in the global economy and reforms such as auto-enrolment still bedding in, to turn things on their head.
The prospect of radical reform had also been opposed by the pensions industry.
Changes to the pensions system in recent years have included automatic enrolment into workplace pensions in 2012, and people aged 55 and over being allowed to take their retirement pots how they want rather than being required to buy an annuity retirement income - introduced in 2015.",Chancellor George Osborne has dropped plans to end or alter tax relief on pension contributions.

""In one group you've got me, Harry Aikines-Aryeetey and James Ellington, who are ranked first, second and third in the country at the moment, which is great,"" Kilty said.
""And then the other group has got Adam Gemili and James Dasaolu, who were the top best sprinters last year, so it's a massive rivalry.""
However, Kilty hopes the differences between the two camps can be settled for the benefit of the relay team, which will compete at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow and European Championships in Zurich this summer.
""I try to keep it as professional as I can,"" added Kilty. ""They are all part of the British relay team and I think we all need to get along because, if the quickest relay team were to be put out there, you'd have two members of one group and two members of the other group.
""And we can smash the British record if we do. We can challenge the Jamaicans and the Americans with that squad as long as we can work together. It's a bit of a shame on that point, but hopefully we can work together.
""I'm on speaking terms and friendly with the others, but I know there is still tension between the other athletes in our group and their group and the two coaches.""
Dasaolu and Gemili will not be competing at the World Relay Championships in Bahamas on 24 and 25 May as the former is building his fitness after a hamstring injury and the latter has university exams.",World indoor 60m champion Richard Kilty says there is a rift between Britain's two male sprinting camps.
326,"John Lumsden Donaldson, 61, is well aware of what those organisations have been going through.
His business was ""virtually closed down for 24 hours"" when he was the victim of a similar attack.
And it was only the efforts of his computer programmer son Mark which got his business back up and running.
""It's not just the big companies that have been attacked,"" John told the BBC.
""We were attacked on Thursday 4 May.""
When John opened his doors that day as usual, he had little idea of the problems that lay in store.
He runs an auction company in Spain, where he lives in Formentera del Segura. It is a small business, employing fewer than ten people.
""None of the software would work on our network of computers in the office,"" he said.
""I thought my son might be updating the network.""
He rang his son to check.
""Within five minutes he rang back and told me to unplug the servers and close down the system.
""He said we were being hacked.""
John's business had been targeted with ransomware - software which infects vulnerable machines, locks data away and demands payment to unencrypt those files.
""They didn't take anything from us. They just wanted $500 (Â£390),"" John said.
""I said we should just pay. But my son said there was no guarantee they would unencrypt the files after we had paid and they might ask for more money.""
John's business uses two servers in England and two physical servers in Spain. All four use Windows operating systems - those in England running the newer Windows 10; those in Spain using an older iteration of Windows Server.
""They locked up our system files so we couldn't run any of our software or access customer data. We could not pay our customers.
""I was worried about the security of our clients but they didn't access any of that part. It was our physical servers in Spain.
""They found a backdoor in Windows Server through our telephone line.""
John and Mark worked overnight to resolve the problem.
""Even now we still have issues,"" John said. ""According to my son it's all linked to old Windows software.
""I really felt for our customers. It was a bit embarrassing to say the least.
""Thank God I had my son.""

327,"Economic nationalists like senior adviser Steve Bannon view withdrawal as visible way for the US to demonstrate that it's putting its own economic interests ahead of the concerns of the ""international community"".
Movement conservatives, including Environmental Protection Agency head Scott Pruitt, are keen to strike a blow to the environmentalist coalition, which they view as creeping socialism cloaked in an earth-friendly guise.
Meanwhile Mr Trump's working-class supporters - particularly those in the economically distressed coal-producing regions of West Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania that delivered an Electoral College victory to the president - are more concerned about jobs and their way of life, rather than the distant, amorphous threat of rising sea levels or shifting climate patterns.
Ivanka Trump, along with her husband (and senior White House adviser) Jared Kushner, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Secretary of Defence James Mattis, were reportedly strong advocates for remaining in the agreement - for a range of environmental, diplomatic and national security reasons.
The president's daughter even arranged for her father to meet politician-turned-activist Al Gore to discuss the issue during the presidential transition.
The efforts always figured to be an uphill battle, however, given the issues and interests that formed the heart of Mr Trump's presidential campaign.
Mr Trump once notably called global warming a ""hoax"" perpetrated by the Chinese, but over the course of last year's campaign he was largely silent on environmental issues.
He spoke early and often about jobs, the economy and government overregulation, however, and will likely frame any move to abandon the Paris agreement as evidence that his presidency is taking action to put more money in American pockets.
If such a move angers the international elite, US liberals and media talking heads, so much the better.",While a presidential decision to pull out of the Paris Agreement would roil the international community and frustrate White House advocates of addressing climate change - including Donald Trump's own daughter - there are formidable forces within the administration in favour of such a move.
328,"Last year the authorities learned of 946 victims, compared with 710 in 2010, the inter-departmental ministerial group on human trafficking said.
Trafficking gangs in China, Vietnam, Nigeria and eastern Europe now pose the biggest threat to the UK , it said.
The government said better co-ordination between its departments and with authorities abroad was key.
But anti-slavery groups warned government ""failures"" had led to ""significant steps back"" in the fight.

In Ilford, East London, the police moved in at 05:15 BST, smashing through the door of an end of terrace house, but without result. It was empty.
The Met says it carries out two such raids every week, on average.
Two miles away in a second house, they found a Lithuanian family living in one room. A stack of mail showed that a large number of people have stayed there before.
They questioned the Lithuanians who said they were being paid below minimum wage to work in a recycling depot and building firm.
The room costs Â£140 a week. There was a CCTV camera watching the door of the house.
Are they victims of people trafficking? It's not clear, and often those involved haven't asked themselves the same question.
But police say those who try to run are often subject to violence.
There is currently no official figure for the number of victims trafficked into the country each year.
However, the report said 712 adult victims and 234 child victims were reported last year to the National Referral Mechanism, the official body that identifies and looks after those caught up in trafficking.
Of the victims referred in 2010, 524 were adults and 186 were children.
It is thought the increase could be explained by improvements in identifying victims, although campaigners say the figures of those being trafficked could be far higher as many victims choose not to come forward for fear of being deported.
The report suggested an increase in the number of children being forced into crime, including street begging.
The Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre estimates there are about 300 child trafficking victims in the UK every year.
The report also detailed two cases of people trafficked for illegal organ removals, but they were detected and stopped before the operations were carried out.
One involved the planned sale of a victim's kidneys.
Det Insp Kevin Hyland, of London's Metropolitan Police - which sees the UK's highest rates of trafficking - said some victims travelled to the UK in lorries or containers but the majority arrived lawfully, often accompanied by their traffickers.
""The vast majority of them think they're coming to a better life in the UK,"" he said.
Mr Hyland said it was often ""almost impossible"" for border guards to spot victims because they often did not even know they were being trafficked.
Many victims are promised jobs in the hotel or leisure industry, or as interpreters, but when they arrive they are ""groomed or threatened"" and used for sexual exploitation, forced labour or both, he said.
In London, police deal with more than 100 cases of trafficking a year. Some will involve more than 400 victims but the majority involve about 10 to 15 people.
The report revealed the largest number of referrals of potential victims of trafficking were Nigerian nationals. From within Europe, Romanian nationals were the biggest group referred.
There are an estimated 92 organised crime groups in the UK with known involvement in human trafficking, it said.
And 142 defendants were charged with offences related to human trafficking in 2011/12.

The two potential victims of organ trafficking in the UK in 2011 are the first people identified as being forced into giving up their internal organs for transplant.
But it's still a small problem, with organ trafficking making up only 1% of all potential victims of trafficking last year, according to the Serious Organised Crime Association.
Cases of illegal organ trading are rare in the UK because of safeguards in place.
The Human Tissue Authority sees 1,200 cases a year of living organ donation - 95% involve kidneys and 5% liver lobes.
These cases include people making altruistic organ donations and those coming from abroad to donate organs to family members.
The HTA interviews all potential donors to make sure they are consenting freely and to ensure there is no reward or payment.
The process can take up to six months with the donor required to sign a form stating no coercion was involved.
Only when the HTA is satisfied would the operation be allowed to go ahead.
Advice is being drafted for NHS staff to help them identify potential cases of organ trafficking.
The report concluded intelligence sharing with international police forces was already ""proving effective"".
Immigration minister Mark Harper said the results demonstrated UK professionals were getting better at ""spotting"" the crime due to ""cross-government"" cooperation.
""We're doing a better job of cracking down people involved in the vile trade,"" he told BBC Radio 5 Live.
But the number of those prosecuted was ""not enough,"" he said.
""One of the things we do is to prosecute people for the most serious offences we can, and sometimes that's not a trafficking offence.""
Mr Harper also said agencies needed to ""make sure victims who are trafficked are treated as victims and not as offenders, which has happened in the past"".
Dr Aidan McQuade, director of Anti-Slavery International, said Mr Harper ""must face up to the fact"" that the problem was worsening ""because of fundamental policy failures"".
He said the government viewed the problem ""through the lens of immigration"" and had allowed rights for migrant workers to slip from ""best practice"".
""It would be helpful if the government appointed a national commissioner on trafficking to make sure policy on this issue was unimpeded by politics.""
The report revealed thousands of ""front-line"" workers, including border staff, police and healthcare workers, have been trained to better identify, support and protect victims over the past two years.
Some airlines, including Virgin Atlantic and Thomas Cook, are also training cabin crew to identify those who engaged in trafficking and their potential victims.
And a 24-hour confidential line has been set up for crew to report concerns to border officials before a plane lands in the UK.","The number of people being trafficked into the UK is rising, latest government estimates suggest."
329,"The final annual report from the Independent Monitoring Board for HMP Birmingham described staff morale as ""palpably low"" during the process.
After nearly three years, G4S Care and Justice Services took over the prison in October last year.
However, the board has also welcomed the new owner and ""looks forward to innovations"" that will help the prison.
The Independent Monitoring Board (IMB) was concerned that the privatisation process, with promised announcements, was continually delayed.
It felt that the implementation, from the initial announcement on 31 March to the new owners taking over on 1 October, took too long.
The report praised prison staff who continued to cope with increasing problems, such as gang culture.
During the process, the Prison Service was also bidding to retain the contract and inmates were said to be concerned about the privatisation.
The IMB has recommended that ""lessons be learned from HMP Birmingham's experience"" and that similar processes should be shortened.
Nine other prisons will go through the market-testing process.
A spokesperson for the Ministry of Justice said: ""We will formally respond to the IMB report on HMP Birmingham in due course.
""The public have a right to expect continuing improvement in the quality and efficiency of public services, without compromising public safety.
""The competition strategy and adjustments to the prison estate will help ensure that this is the case, while achieving best value for taxpayers.""",A report has highlighted concerns over the process in which a prison became the first in the UK to be privatised.

The 33-year-old, whose previous deal ran until next year, says he is very settled at Stade Pierre-Mauroy.
""I am very happy to extend my contract with Lille, a club I call home,"" Enyeama told BBC Sport.
""I love the family atmosphere here and would like to thank the club for the incredible confidence they have placed in me since I joined five years ago.

331,"Here's a look back at some of the show's most memorable moments:
The birth of one of pop music's biggest beefs all started when Kanye West jumped on stage in the middle of Taylor Swift accepting her award for best female video.
When Swift's video for You Belong With Me beat Beyonce's Single Ladies, the rapper headed for the stage and took Taylor's microphone.
He said: ""Taylor, I'm really happy for you, and I'ma let you finish... but BeyoncÃ© had one of the best videos of all time.""
Kanye was booed by he audience, and when Beyonce herself accepted the award for video of the year later in the ceremony, she invited Swift back onstage to finish her speech.
Although Britney Spears was already a global superstar, this moment cemented her status as a pop culture icon as she performed her hit song I'm a Slave 4 U whilst draped with a seven-foot Burmese python.
Peta (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) and several other animal rights groups weren't too thrilled about this.
Recalling the performance last year, Britney said: ""Oh my goodness, why did I do that? That was so dumb,"" adding that she would ""never"" do it again.
Lady Gaga is no stranger to shocking the world with crazy outfits, and this one surely topped the list.
In 2010, the pop star accepted her video of the year award in a dress made from raw beef.
The dress was condemned by several animal rights groups but went on to be inducted in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2011.
In an  interview with American news anchor Anderson Cooper, Gaga explained that her dress was in protest against the US military's ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy, a rule that banned open homosexuality in the armed forces.
Beyonce announced her pregnancy with Blue Ivy in the most Beyonce way ever.
After delivering a killer performance of Love On Top, she unbuttoned her blazer, dropped her microphone on the floor (we're sure the sound engineers were big fans of that) and began rubbing her tummy.
The audience (and her fanbase) went suitably crazy.
Madonna isn't a stranger to delivering crazy performances - from hanging on a crucifix to rocking up in a ball gown as a French royal, we've seen it all.
And whilst her 1984 performance at the VMAs would be considered quite tame by today's standards, at the time it was pretty groundbreaking.
From her wedding dress costume, to the massive cake she emerged from to her hip thrusting on stage, critics suggested Madonna had set the standard for other artists performing at the VMAs to match.
Britney and VMA stunts go hand-in-hand, so it's perhaps unsurprising she features more on our list than anybody else.
The singer started her 2000 performance in a tuxedo whilst singing I Can't Get No (Satisfaction). All very formal and elegant.
But then the whole world watched Britney rip off her clothes to reveal a skin-tone, bedazzled body suit as she began to sing Oops... I Did It Again.
Critics cited this moment as a turning point for Britney's career - between the song and the costume, she did a pretty good job of trying to shed that Mickey Mouse Club image and show the world she was growing up.
One of the most jaw dropping moments of VMA history was when Nicki Minaj called out Miley Cyrus.
It all started when the rapper criticised MTV for leaving Anaconda out of the video of the year category, implying that she would have been nominated if she was white.
Taylor Swift took this as a jab directed at her and responded on Twitter, after which the two engaged in a war of words. And then Miley weighed in on the topic.
""What I read sounded very Nicki Minaj, which, if you know Nicki Minaj, is not too kind,"" Miley said.
""It's not very polite. I think there's a way you speak to people with openness and love. You don't have to start this pop star against pop star war.""
As Nicki accepted her award on stage and handed back to Miley, who was hosting the ceremony, she said: ""And now, back to this [girl] that had a lot to say about me the other day in the press. Miley, what's good?""
Nicki later explained to The New York Times Magazine: ""I saw [Miley] just looking at me, with her face screwed up, and I thought, 'What the...?'""
""The fact that you feel upset about me speaking on something that affects black women makes me feel like you have some big balls.""
And while we're on the subject of Miley Cyrus...
After finishing her performance of We Can't Stop in 2013, the singer was joined on stage by Robin Thicke and that's when things got a little... R-rated.
As Thicke began singing the controversial Blurred Lines, Cyrus began stroking him with a foam finger and doing her own interpretation of ""twerking"" in her latex beige bikini.
After Twitter melted, the singer defended it and claimed that she wanted to make history (mission accomplished) - but now it seems she regrets it.
Natia Kirkland - commonly known as Lil Mama - seemed to have got caught up in the moment when Jay-Z and Alicia Keys were performing their ode to New York, Empire State of Mind.
As the song came to a close, Kirkland who is also a native New Yorker, jumped on stage and posed next to the two superstars with Jay-Z trying his hardest to ignore her.
In the middle of performing a mash-up of hits in 2003, Madonna surprised the world by kissing Britney Spears onstage.
After cutting to the confused look on Justin Timberlake's face, Madonna then kissed Christina Aguilera.
At a time where both Spears and Aguilera were still trying to shake off their innocent teen-idol images, the kiss was an unforgettable VMA moment.

332,"The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) also advised against packing the phones into any checked-in luggage.
Samsung recalled the phone last week after reports emerged of the device exploding during or after charging.
Qantas and Virgin Australia have also told customers not to charge or use the phone during flights.
Samsung said it would speed up shipments of replacement Galaxy Note 7 phones to ease safety concerns.
Earlier this week, US TV channel Fox 10 reported claims that a faulty Galaxy Note 7 had set fire to a family's Jeep.
Samsung has said that battery problems were behind the phones catching fire, but that it was difficult to work out which phones were affected among those sold.
""In light of recent incidents and concerns raised by Samsung about its Galaxy Note 7 devices, the Federal Aviation Administration strongly advises passengers not to turn on or charge these devices on board aircraft and not to stow them in any checked baggage,"" the FAA said.
Following Samsung's recall of its Galaxy Note 7, Qantas said on Thursday it was ""requesting that passengers who own [the devices] do not switch on or charge them in-flight.""
The phone was launched last month and has been otherwise generally well-received by consumers and critics.
Some 2.5 million Note 7s have been shipped globally.
Samsung has said customers who have already bought the phone will be able to swap it for a new one and that it would take about two weeks to prepare replacement devices.
Analysis: Dave Lee, BBC North America technology reporter
This is precautionary advice and not understood to be in reaction to any incident on a plane.
But it does continue the headache for Samsung - even once the company goes through the motions of getting the device recalled, the Note 7 will forever be the exploding smartphone.
This is not the first time the FAA has warned about the dangers of lithium batteries on flights. Earlier this year, it urged airlines to assess the risk of transporting lithium batteries as cargo.
And the administration also insists that any spare lithium battery be kept with the passenger rather than kept with luggage in the hold - though as a person who regularly travels with big lithium batteries for camera equipment, I can tell you this is inconsistently enforced.
What makes lithium batteries catch fire?
The US trade group Airlines for America said it was ""closely monitoring"" the Note 7 issue and that carriers in the US would make their own ruling over the use of the phone on board.
""Each individual carrier makes determinations, in compliance with FAA safety rules and regulations, as to what is permitted to be carried on board and in the cargo hold,"" an Airlines for America spokesperson said in a statement.

She said they were sent to Sinn Féin who, so far, had not responded.
However, Sinn Féin's MLA Conor Murphy said they were ""insufficient"".
""There has been no agreement with the DUP on the terms of reference of an independent investigation,"" he said.
""In order to restore public confidence in the political institutions we need an independent investigation, which is robust, transparent, timeframed and led by a senior judicial figure from outside the jurisdiction and with the power to compel witnesses and subpoena documents.

Set up in November 2012, the Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) scheme was an attempt by the Northern Ireland Executive to help to increase consumption of heat from renewable sources.
It is approximately £490m over budget as businesses were receiving more in subsidies than they were paying for renewable fuel and the scheme became heavily oversubscribed.",Sinn Féin has said terms of reference drawn up by the head of the civil service for an investigation into the RHI debacle are short of what is required.
334,"The Ivorian left the Swans for the Etihad Stadium on a four-year contract in 2015 for a fee worth up to £28m.
Bony, 28, managed only eight goals in 46 appearances for City - more than half of which came as a substitute - and spent last season on loan at Stoke.
His potential return to Wales could depend on the future of Swansea's top scorer last season, Fernando Llorente.
The 32-year-old, who is currently sidelined with an arm injury, has been a transfer target for Chelsea, having worked with the Premier League champions' manager, Antonio Conte, at Juventus.
Swansea have yet to receive a bid this summer for the Spain international, who scored 15 goals last season to help the Welsh club avoid relegation from the top flight.
The Swans did reject offers for Llorente during the January transfer window, and a move for Bony could be seen as insurance should Llorente leave.
Swansea signed England Under-21 striker Tammy Abraham on a season-long loan from Chelsea earlier this summer.
But with club record signing Borja Baston on loan at Malaga, the Swans could be short of forward options if Llorente was to leave.
Before Baston's arrival, Bony was Swansea's record signing when he joined from Vitesse Arnhem for £12m in 2013.
He scored 34 goals in all competitions for the Swans before his move to City.
Bony's high wages at City were thought to be a stumbling block for a potential return to the Liberty Stadium, though Swansea could soon have more money if midfielder Gylfi Sigurdsson joins Everton.",Swansea City are weighing up a move to re-sign striker Wilfried Bony from Manchester City.

""He's doing great. So long as we're here, he'll be in the car next year.""
Horner's comments seem to end speculation that Toro Rosso's Max Verstappen might be promoted to the senior team after an impressive debut season for the 18-year-old Dutchman.
Red Bull's participation is still in doubt because they have not yet confirmed whether they have an engine for 2016.
The team were last month close to concluding negotiations to terminate their contract with Renault a year early due to growing tensions between the two.
But those talks stopped when it became clear Mercedes would not supply Red Bull and Ferrari said they could not supply them their 2016 engine next season.
Insiders say that Red Bull are now likely to continue with Renault but with the engine given a different name so it does not appear to casual audience as if the relationship has continued.
Renault are on the verge of taking control of the Lotus team and returning as a team owner and constructor.
However, Horner suggested there was still another possibility for Red Bull: ""There may be something else. We'll see.""

In a sport like rugby union, where players have never been bigger, faster, or hit harder for longer, might is right like never before. Which makes the continual influence of Dan Carter not just illogical but something close to miraculous.
On Saturday evening in Lyon, Carter - the leading points scorer in Test history, reigning World Rugby player of the year, World Cup winner for a second time seven months ago - will, in characteristically undemonstrative fashion, lead Racing 92's charge as they take on Saracens in the Champions Cup final.

The All Blacks great is not only a physical throw-back in a game increasingly for the outsized and enormous. At 5ft 10in and 14 stone, the 34-year-old plays an old-fashioned way: finding space where others seek contact, appearing unhurried when fly-halves have never had less time, still managing to play on instinct when set moves and patterns are everywhere you look.
It's not that Carter doesn't do the nasty stuff. In Racing's semi-final win over Leicester Tigers he made 16 tackles.
It's how he does it. Whereas Jonny Wilkinson, the original big-hitting number 10, stopped opposition runners like a rogue flanker and brought gasps from the stands and lungs of the victim alike, Carter tackles like he does everything else - with economy rather than anger, with perfect yet undemonstrative technique, with efficiency over ostentation.
Carter is not quite the player he was. The outside break and sudden acceleration that defined so many of his early masterclasses have quietly been lost to the years. It doesn't really matter. In his swansong he appears to worry less about what he lacks than utilise what he does.
If it wasn't the sort of thing that in his home town of Southbridge would trigger disbelief - expressed, because this is the South Island of New Zealand, by something as flamboyant as a raised eyebrow or muted cough - you'd say it was all rather Zen: the impossible calm in a sporting storm, the balance between self and team, equanimity in even the biggest occasions.
There is the ritual of his relentless kicking practice, whether at the posts that his father put up next to the family home or on the foreign fields of France; the meditation brought about by those repeated simple actions; the carefully constructed humility of an All Blacks environment where 100-cap heroes like Carter and retired captain Richie McCaw were expected to clean up the dressing room like backroom juniors.
And it is all done in the most unobtrusive way. Wilkinson kicked from the tee with such exaggerated movements that half-cut punters in pubs could do impressions. Dan Biggar has his little soft-shoe shuffle, the 'Biggarena'. Owen Farrell, Carter's opposite number on Saturday, has the laser eyes and robotic head-turn.
Carter? Even after so many penalties and conversions, it's still hard to remember exactly how he looks in sweet motion. The fact that he has been the same with ball in hand - perfectly timed passes or offloads, but all done in the most discreet and understated way - have sometimes made it hard for people to understand what has made him so special. He doesn't always stand out, so how can he be outstanding?
""He's fascinating,"" admits Ronan O'Gara, arguably Ireland's finest fly-half and now, in early retirement, assistant coach at Carter's Racing.
""He's just extremely humble, extremely respectful. He smiles, he always finds a way of getting the job done.
""He doesn't stress, he's always polite, he's a breath of fresh air. You can learn an awful lot by just watching him.""
Carter isn't the only sporting great who can appear to be operating in slow-motion and fast-forward at the same time, but he maintains that composure longer than most.
Tennis' Roger Federer at his best was both unhurried and unflustered, but at the moment of victory all that held-back emotion would come crashing out. In cricket, Chris Gayle remains expressionless when thrashing unfortunate bowlers for six after six, but will dance with his top off when victory has been won.
Lionel Messi, for all the gossamer touches with that left foot, is all beautiful bustle and obvious energy, Cristiano Ronaldo all strut and preen on the football pitch.
Even Tiger Woods, who before his fall could hold his form and nerve in the final-round meltdown like no other golfer, would spit and cuss his way round the course when the mojo left his side.
Carter, in the biggest moments he has faced, has looked as perturbed as if he were back at Christchurch Boys' High School, from the second Test against the Lions in 2005, when he turned in a performance that led to him being described as ""the perfect 10"", all the way through to last October's World Cup final.
Against the Wallabies at Twickenham that day, there was a moment to epitomise so much of what had come before: the All Blacks suddenly under huge pressure, their 17-point lead cut to just four with 15 minutes to go.
In his first 110 Tests Carter had landed a total of just six drop-goals. A week after adding another to put away South Africa in the semi-finals, he took a pass flat with the defence charging, his feet and eyes set for the short pass to Sonny Bill Williams on his outside shoulder.
Forty metres out, the game's greatest prize in the balance, chaos all around. Not for Carter. Instead, a little pocket of space and tranquillity and time where no-one else could see it, a turn of the shoulders and hips, a perfect contact with his left boot to send the ball arcing between the sticks.
Wilkinson was also touched by Eastern philosophy, first by Buddhism as cruel injuries kept keeping him out, later by a Japanese school of thought called Kaizen.
Because of the man that Wilkinson is, that was more about a tortured form of self-improvement. ""You imagine being watched by a video 24/7 to help you get better each day and make good decisions,"" he has said.
For Farrell, who shares much of Wilkinson's dedication, Saturday is also about a particular kind of personal development.
After his yellow card in the critical World Cup group match against Australia and the two-week ban for a dangerous tackle after Saracens' Champions Cup semi-final win over Wasps, he will be watching Carter not just to keep his influence in check but to learn from the old master too.
""It's just how calm he is, how much he is in control of what he does that stands out,"" the fiery Farrell says.
""Trying to be calmer on the pitch, it's definitely something I'm always trying to do. The more you're calm, the more you're in control and the more you're thinking about the right things.""
Carter in control. The career moves on, but the philosophy remains the same.

337,"Extra patrols have been launched to deal with an increase in anti-social behaviour fuelled by the drug, said to leave users in a ""zombie-like"" state.
Officers were called to 58 incidents related to Spice in the city centre between Friday and Sunday.
""We cannot afford"" for the problem to get worse, Ch Supt Wasim Chaudhry said.
Effects of the synthetic drug can be extreme, causing hallucinations, psychosis, muscle weakness and paranoia.
Ch Supt Chaudhry said officers were doing all they could to tackle the issue but ""a multi-agency approach is the only way we can fight this battle"".
""The truth is, tackling the issues caused by Spice is putting pressure on public services and is taking up a lot of our resources, particularly in Manchester city centre,"" he said.
""Those who take Spice are often left incapacitated or seriously ill and need the help of our partners in the NHS and ambulance service.
""They can also become aggressive and become a danger to themselves and others.""
He said it was ""a problem that we cannot afford to get any worse"".
The Greater Manchester force has increased the number of specially-trained officers dealing with the issue.
It has also been working with Manchester City Council's adults and children's services, rough sleeper and outreach teams, local charities, as well as North West Ambulance Service and the NHS, he said.
Councillor Pat Karney said he wanted to discuss the problem with Home Secretary Amber Rudd because ""the experience in Manchester is going to spread up and down this country"".
""What is happening in Manchester will happen nationally so the next steps we're taking is to see the chief constable and review the situation, and then we're going to be seeking a meeting with the home secretary,"" he said.
Daniel Gerrard, Founder of Addiction Helper and Family Interventionist, believes that the term 'Legal High' is where the problem really started, as it stigmatised the drugs in such a way that it made them more widespread and acceptable to use.
""Illegal Highs like Spice should be classed as Category A Drugs. This will allow us to educate those using and those thinking of trying it for the first time that extremely serious consequences are attached with this drug.
""My experience with those addicted to Spice is that they can be very volatile and present with mental health issues, often without mental health being an issue prior to using Spice.
""The fact of the matter is that more and more addicts are dying and the addiction problem continues to rise. Addiction treatment should not be reduced because of austerity, as the recent crisis with this drug should make quite clear.""","A rise in the use of former legal high Spice in Manchester is putting pressure on public services, police say."
338,"The ""virtual orchestra"" included everything from bell ringers to cellists, all of whom had uploaded their performance to the BBC.
A video combining all 1,200 performances was shown at Proms in the Park events around the UK and as part of BBC Two's coverage of the event.
The Prom also featured an unusual rendition of Rule Britannia.
Peruvian Juan Diego Florez chose to sing the anthem in B Major - the highest pitch ever chosen by a tenor at the event.
""I think it's more comfortable, more exciting, more fun,"" he told the BBC. ""I'm glad that I'm the first one doing it.""
The musician stole the show by performing the song in the colourful costume of Manco Capac, governor and founder of the Inca civilization.
Earlier, the dashing tenor had serenaded a cuddly toy of fellow Peruvian Paddington Bear during a performance of Guantanamera - part of a medley of popular Latin songs.
""He is as Peruvian as me,"" he told the audience. ""You know, he was found in Paddington Station... [but] nobody in Peru knows about this.
""Anyway, I know him, I love him.""
The build-up to the Last Night was marked by an attempt to hijack the concert's tradition of flag-waving for political means.
Anti-Brexit campaigners handed out EU flags outside the Royal Albert Hall, hoping for a wave of support from Prommers, who more usually wave union flags during the last night.
The organisers, who wanted to remain anonymous, said in a statement: ""Music doesn't recognise borders, religion, gender, age, status or creed and most orchestras, shows and music schools rely heavily on talented musicians from inside and outside the EU.""
They added: ""Accordionist Romano Viazzani summed it up perfectly when he said: 'Music is the universal language. It builds bridges and tears down walls.'""
Prominent Brexit backer Aaron Banks retaliated by pledging to hand out five times as many union jacks as the Brexit team.
In the end, neither side prevailed - as the Royal Albert Hall sported flags from all around the world, including the German, Australian, Danish, Welsh and Cornish flags.
There was also a distinctly international flavour to the programme, conducted by Sakari Oramo, the Finnish music director of the BBC Symphony Orchestra.
He led the musicians through works by French, German, Russian and Italian composers; while Anne Dudley contributed a special arrangement of Fiesta Caribena!
Perhaps in response to the planned protest, Oramo told the audience: ""Listening to music in a concentrated way gives us the chanceâ€¦ to find resolution, peace and unity.
""Music enables us to be in dialogue with each other, and our innermost selves. A dialogue which is more necessary in these days than ever before.""
The concert also included Michael Torke's Javelin, which was originally performed at the opening ceremony of the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, and a hand-picked selection of young singers performing Vaughan Williams' Serenade to Music - a tribute to Henry Wood, whose name is synonymous with the Proms.
In keeping with tradition, the concert - and the 2016 season - closed with Rule Britannia, Land of Hope and Glory and Jerusalem.
Around the UK, classical music fans were able to join in the celebrations at Proms in the Park events; with special appearances by pianist Ruth McGinley and soprano Lesley Garret in Belfast, Northern Ireland.
Thirteen-year-old Gwydion Rhys was given the opportunity to conduct the BBC National Orchestra of Wales in a performance of Ride of the Valkyries at the Welsh Prom, in Colwyn Bay.
Britain's Got Talent winners Collabro appeared at the Scottish leg, in Glasgow Green; while London's line-up included Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons, Rick Astley, Sir James Galway, Tim Minchin and the cast of Matilda The Musical.
The events brought the two month-long Proms season to a close, after more than 100 concerts.
Highlights included the  SimÃ³n Bolivar Orchestra, from Caracas, who put on a colourful, exotic evening, full of evocations of Latin America; and  a spine-tingling programme of Steve Reich, performed on the roof of a Peckham car park.
A late night Prom paid tribute to the life and music of David Bowie, with mixed results; while Quincy Jones and Strictly Come Dancing were also honoured with their own programmes.

The midfielder revealed he had spoken first to the Celtic striker before signing his four-year contract.
""Moussa told me the club was good, it was fun here,"" said his fellow 21-year-old, who spent the last two seasons on loan with Genoa in Serie A.
""I'm very happy to be here and it's a new challenge for me.""
Ntcham never made the breakthrough into the senior side at the Etihad but did make 41 appearances during his two-year spell in Italy, 22 of them starts.
Genoa finished 11th in his first campaign in Serie A, but the Frenchman made only 10 starts as the Red and Blues ended last season in 16th place, two spots above the relegation zone.
He now hopes to mirror the success of compatriot Dembele, whose stunning debut season in Scottish football following his transfer from Fulham has led to him being linked with a move to some of European football's biggest clubs.
The France Under-21 striker was a team-mate of Ntcham's earlier in their international age-grade careers, recalling: ""I was maybe 14 when we played together.""
And the new arrival hopes Dembele sticks around to help him adapt to life in Scotland.
""He knows not all clubs are in the Champions League, so if you play in the Champions League, it's always good to stay,"" said Ntcham.
""That's why I chose to come here.""
Ntcham revealed he held talks with Celtic back in January and says a desire to play regular first-team football was a key factor in his decision to leave England's top flight and join Brendan Rodgers' squad.
""I spoke with Brendan before,"" he said. ""In January, Celtic was already there for me when I was in Italy, so that's why I came here.
""He said to me: 'You have to play because, if you don't play, you don't improve. You have to play because in Italy you don't play a lot'.
""It wasn't a tough decision for me. It was a normal decision because at Manchester City I play three years there and sometimes it is better to leave. Football is like this sometimes.""
Ntcham moved to City's youth ranks in 2012 from the Le Havre academy in his homeland and has represented France at every youth level from under-16s upwards.
Asked what kind of player Celtic fans can expect, he said: ""I am a powerful player and technical as well I think.""

340,"Ilkeston in Derbyshire is one of the largest towns in the UK without a rail station after its previous one closed in 1967, due to Dr Beeching's cuts.
However, the project suffered several delays, notably because of newts that had to be trapped and relocated.
The station, off Millership Way, is due to open later this year.
Plans to dismantle the old bridge were postponed after foundation work on the new platforms took longer than expected.
It is the latest delay to the project which first got the go-ahead in January 2014 - work was due to start six months later.
However, the rare newts - a species protected by law - were found during a routine ecological site survey and work was ordered not to begin until they were removed.
Flooding concerns at the site delayed the project further, and again in February 2015 when even more newts were found, prompting some to question the species' rarity.
The delays ""disappointed"" local councillors and ""frustrated"" the then transport secretary Patrick McLoughlin.
Work finally started to demolish the old station in March 2015.
Councillor Dean Collins, from the county council, said: ""The new station will be a great boost to the area.
""Large-scale engineering projects like this can often unearth unforeseen issues and while we've had a few setbacks, we're working hard to get the station up and running as soon as we can.""
A number of road closures will be in place while the old footbridge is taken down and the new one erected.
Once the station opens, services to Chesterfield, Sheffield, Leeds and Nottingham will begin with 160,000 passengers expected to pass through the station.",Work has started on a footbridge at the site of a £10m railway station where construction efforts stalled due to concerns over rare great crested newts.

The CCTV footage shows the man pouring liquid around and setting it alight.
He is about 5ft 10in tall and was wearing a blue tracksuit, a hat with an luminous rear band and dark shoes.
Det Con Stephen Cooke, of Police Scotland, said: ""This was a deliberate and dangerous act which has caused extensive damage to the centre.

342,"But the ""You Stink"" campaign said the decision did not mean it was giving up.
The move comes after two days of demonstrations in the capital descended into clashes in which dozens of protesters and police were hurt.
Prime Minister Tammam Salam has appealed for calm and threatened to resign over the crisis.
In a televised address on Sunday, he warned that Lebanon was heading towards collapse, with the country's ""political garbage"" crippling his unity cabinet.
Thousands of people gathered outside the prime minister's office in central Beirut on Sunday to protest against the government's failure to have the large piles of rubbish which have been building up in the capital for weeks removed.
Chanting ""the people want the downfall of the regime"", some protesters threw rocks and sticks at riot police and lit fires. Officers responded by firing water cannon and tear gas.
The clashes left at least 44 demonstrators and 30 police officers injured, officials said. Dozens of people were also injured on Saturday, when police fired rubber bullets.
Like the issue of electricity in Iraq, the failure of a public utility in Lebanon - rubbish collection - has brought to a head simmering, chronic public indignation over a deadlocked political system riddled with corruption, inefficiency and sectarianism.
As the embattled Prime Minister Tammam Salam pointed out, it is this issue that threw the spotlight on the ""political rubbish"" that is the real problem - one that has paralysed his own cabinet and the twice-prorogued parliament from taking effective decisions on any issue.
Behind the political stagnation is the unbending stand-off between the two major political blocs, divided primarily over attitudes to the Syrian regime - the Iranian-backed Hezbollah and its mainly Shia allies on one side, and the Saudi-backed, mainly Sunni pro-Western 14 March movement.
Mr Salam's warning of an imminent collapse should be a wake-up call to those blocs that it is time to collaborate on solutions, not least to the 15-month vacancy at the country's presidency. That seems unlikely, with regional struggles as unresolved as they are.
Protesters are also broadening their demands to include an end to the pervasive sectarian political system, something that is even harder to imagine.
But public pressure is mounting. If it can at least get the rubbish collected and safely disposed of, that will be a start.
Lebanon wracked by dysfunction
Lebanon cartoons vent anger at rubbish crisis
On Monday, the campaign announced that the demonstration planned for Monday evening had been postponed.
""The movement has not and will not stop,"" a statement on its Facebook page said. ""Postponing from today to another date this week is not a retreat. We need to reassess and organise our demands.""
You Stink leader Hassan Shams earlier blamed ""infiltrators"" for the violence over the weekend. ""We started peacefully, and we will continue peacefully,"" he told New TV.
The protests have been largely co-ordinated by You Stink, which was formed when rubbish began piling up on the streets of Beirut and neighbouring areas after the country's largest landfill was closed last month, with no ready alternative.
Activists blame political paralysis and corruption for the failure to resolve the crisis.
Fouad al-Hassan, a 65-year-old actor, told the New York Times that he had decided to attend Sunday's rally because he wanted to ""change the system"".
""We want new blood or the country will stay the same,"" he added.
Lebanon has been without a president for more than a year, while members of parliament have extended their own terms until 2017 after failing to agree on a law to govern fresh elections.
The conflict in neighbouring Syria has also exacerbated political and sectarian divisions, and resulted in the arrival of 1.1 million refugees, putting a strain on the economy and public services.
Mr Salam said that if a cabinet meeting scheduled for Thursday was not productive on several issues, including the rubbish crisis, ""there would be no necessity for the government after it"".
""I warn that we are going towards collapse if matters continue,"" he added.
""Frankly, I have not and will not be a partner in this collapse. Let all officials and political forces bear their responsibilities.""
The prime minister also warned that the government, which brings together all the main Lebanese parties, would be unable to pay civil servants' salaries next month and risked being classified a ""failing state"".
If Mr Salam were to resign it could trigger a constitutional crisis because his replacement has to be appointed by the president.",Organisers of protests over the failure of Lebanon's government to clear rubbish from the streets of Beirut have postponed a rally planned for Monday.
343,"The Colin Tizzard-trained seven-year-old ranged up alongside Willie Mullins' Un De Sceaux (10-11 fav) at the final fence and pulled clear on the run-in.
Fox Norton (5-2),  who also won the Melling Chase at Aintree, got home by a length and three quarters.
God's Own (7-1), last year's winner, was just half a length away in third.
The victory gave jockey Robbie Power a seventh Grade One win of the campaign.
Fox Norton has been a model of consistency since joining the Tizzard team, and was a close second to Special Tiara in the Queen Mother Champion Chase.
He was not inconvenienced by the return to two miles, with the strong pace set by Un De Sceaux and Rock The World playing to his strengths.
""Robbie was cool. He didn't get involved in any battles until he had to,"" said Tizzard. ""The horse made a few mistakes and Robbie said he was going flat out the whole time.
""If you saw this horse on the gallops you'd never think he was a champion two-miler. Honestly, slow three-milers would beat him.
""This is why we get up in the morning and why we go looking at horses, to come and win at places like Punchestown. It's fantastic.""
Asked if Fox Norton could step up in trip next season, Tizzard added: ""I think there's every temptation.
""That was his minimum and if there had been a two-and-a-half-miler here he would have been in that.
""He'd get three miles, but of course Sizing John is there. I think he'd get two and a half or three.""
Mullins said of Un De Sceaux: ""We've had a fantastic season with him and will put him away now.
""The faster pace over two miles on better ground didn't suit him.""

Robbie Power continues to live up to his surname in great style, adding this prize to a string of big-race success at Cheltenham, Aintree and Fairyhouse.
We've long known he's an excellent rider, but the confidence he must be feeling is being transmitted down the reins to his mounts.
Fox Norton took the notable scalp of Un De Sceaux, who has only previously been beaten in completed races in Ireland and Britain by the great Sprinter Sacre, and continues to live up to the type of expectations the Tizzard team has for him.

""You are going to get the best of British competing cheek-by-jowl against the best of the rest of the world. The track and field is the centrepiece of the Olympics and is the main event. I think Team GB are set for their best Olympics ever, as not only are they wonderfully talented, but they'll be competing in front of a partisan crowd. Dai Greene and Mo Farah will be going for gold. Christine Ohuruogu is the defending 400m champion and is raring to go. After all the controversy surrounding South Africa's Caster Semenya, it is going to be great to see her put that all behind her in London. She is definitely the woman to beat in the 800m.""
That athletics event remains the Games' ultimate showstopper and all eyes will be trained on Usain Bolt in the men's final on Sunday 5 August.
But athletics is not just about the track events; there are 47 medal events in all and just over half of these (24) are on the track. The field events, such as the triple jump and javelin, are also popular and have provided Great Britain with Olympic medals in recent years.
For those unable to get tickets for the Olympic Stadium, there are five road races being held on the streets of central London and finishing at the Mall. The women's marathon will see British world record holder Paula Radcliffe attempt to win gold at the third time of asking.
The athletics concludes with the relay races on 11 August, which should provide a fascinating finale. The men's 4x100m has been dominated by the USA but Jamaica - led by that man Bolt - broke the world record to win gold in Beijing.
Athletics offer the widest range of choice of any Olympic sport as its various disciplines provide the opportunity to throw, run or jump.

Immense core physical strength is required to throw a shot put that weighs 16 pounds for men and 8.8 pounds for women.
The test of endurance posed by the marathon sees athletes burn up to 3593 calories running a 26.2 mile course.
For those looking to follow in Bolt's footsteps, research has found sprinting offers a harder workout than slow and steady cardiovascular work such as long-distance running.
It is also an efficient way to reduce body fat and strengthen the heart muscles.
As training sessions are often carried out in groups, it is an excellent way to develop communication skills and learn to work effectively with other people. Clubs also offer a variety of social events beyond simply playing the sport.
Great Britain's Kelly Holmes became the oldest winner of the women's 800m when clinching gold in 2004. The 34-year-old had plenty more to give though - five days later she produced a memorable sprint finish to win the 1500m.

The word athletics is derived from the Greek word 'athlos,' which means ""contest"" or ""task,"" and the sport was first run in an Olympic format in that part world.
Before then, running, walking, jumping, and throwing-based sports had all been performed in a variety of different guises far back into antiquity. Ancient Egyptian tombs dated to approximately 2250 BC have been found that contained depictions of running and high jump competitions.
Discus thrower Jules Noël of France was denied a medal in 1932 when the judges were distracted watching the pole vault and didn't see where his best throw had landed; it would likely have won him gold. Noël, who sneaked off to drink champagne during the competition, was awarded an extra throw but was unable to improve on fourth place.
The first event contested in the ancient Olympic Games was the ""stadium"" race, a sprint of about 192 metres, with recorded winners dating back as far as 776 BC.
The modern format of athletics, competed at a single meeting involving numerous disciplines, evolved in the late 19th century, with the earliest recorded meeting in 1840 in Shropshire, England.
The formation of the Amateur Athletic Association in England in 1880 provided the sport with its first national governing body.
The American Amateur Athletic Union and French Union des sociétés françaises de sports athlétiques followed before the end of that decade.
Athletics has been on the programme of each edition of the Games since 1896, with women's events appearing for the first time at the 1928 Olympics in Amsterdam.
More on the IOC website",It is perhaps fitting that the very first race of the modern Olympics in 1896 was the men's 100 metre sprint.
345,"Members of the EIS union will raise the prospect of industrial action at their annual general meeting this week.
Teachers will also consider action if workload issues remain unresolved after a survey claimed the average teacher worked 46.5 hours a week.
EIS general secretary Larry Flanagan, said: ""These issues must be tackled.""
A Scottish government spokesman said they were working with teachers' representatives, local authorities and other partners ""to address concerns around workload"".
EIS members in Dundee have said that the union's council must ""campaign for a restorative pay deal for teachers which does not link an increased salary with detrimental changes to conditions of service"".
Their motion adds: ""If no satisfactory outcome is forthcoming, members are to be balloted for industrial action up to and including strike action.""
Other motions to be debated at the conference, which will take place in Perth from Thursday to Saturday, could lead to industrial action as a result of changes to the exam system.
The East Ayrshire local association has put forward a motion calling for a ""ballot for a boycott of all SQA-related work unless SQA assessment can be managed within the 35-hour working week.""
Mr Flanagan said: ""Despite the fine words of politicians on the need to support schools and teachers, the evidence from both the recent EIS workload survey - which highlighted an average teacher working week of 46.5 hours - and the range of motions to this year's AGM indicate that excessive workload remains a huge issue for teachers and, therefore, for our schools and our pupils.""
He insisted: ""The message to the Scottish government, to local authorities and national education bodies could not be clearer - you must take action, now, to lighten the load on our schools and our teachers.""
A call for the EIS to ""investigate and report on the impact of teacher shortages"" will also be discussed at the conference, along with a motion condemning ""budget cuts which have been inflicted on Scottish education in recent years"".
A Scottish government spokesman said: ""We are committed to making sure councils have the right number and highest quality of teachers in our schools, which is why we have offered councils Â£51m, including an additional Â£10m over and above last year's settlements to support teacher numbers.
""Education and closing the gap in attainment between children from the most and least deprived communities is a top priority for this government.""","Teachers could be set to strike if they fail to get a ""satisfactory outcome"" in talks over pay, union leaders have warned."

""Rail infrastructure is crucial to opening up the connections to Aberystwyth and beyond,"" she said.
""There is a welcome upturn in economic activity in the area, including the new Aberystwyth University campus nearby.
""This rail stop will cut down on traffic, promote business, reduce pollution, provide a vital transport system for commuters and the elderly.""
The Welsh Government has applied for a £6.8m grant for part funding from the UK government for the project which would include a new train station and interchange plus car parking and bus stops.
Economy Secretary Ken Skates said he had submitted a ""strong"" application for 75% of the cost of the new station - the maximum the UK Government could cover.
He said the Welsh Government would provide the remaining 25% of the funding - £1.7m.
Proposals for a new station at Bow Street have been shown at a public event and, if approved, is hoped will open in 2019.
It would be built a short distance south of the original station, which is now the site of a builders' merchants.
A spokesman for Ceredigion council said it had found ""considerable support"" for the scheme in consultation.

Alumni include Chancellor George Osborne.
Investigations also revealed he had downloaded almost 2,000 images of youngsters, some of whom were as young as 12, and which included topless boys in shorts, boys on a beach, and some who were naked.
Four counts of making indecent images of the most severe level, Category A, were left to lie on file after he pleaded not guilty to them.
Fuggle appeared at Kingston Crown Court and the case was adjourned until 5 June for sentencing.

350,"AMC chief executive Adam Aron had suggested the idea might encourage so-called millennials to visit the cinema.
But the plan was badly received on social media, where cinema-goers bombarded AMC with messages.

AMC operates almost 400 cinemas in the United States, with more than 5,000 screens. The chain also has a UK multi-screen complex in Manchester.
While many cinemas display messages before films asking people to switch off their mobile devices, Mr Aron had suggested that allowing mobile phone use during a film might appeal to young adults.
""When you tell a 22-year-old to turn off the phone, don't ruin the movie, they hear please cut off your left arm above the elbow,"" he had explained in an interview with Variety magazine.
But the cinema chain has now admitted the idea had not gone down well with audiences.
""In this age of social media, we get feedback from you almost instantaneously,"" it said in a statement.
""This is an idea we have relegated to the cutting room floor... there will be no texting allowed in any of the auditoriums at AMC Theatres.""

351,"Francis used his ""Urbi et Orbi"" address to call for peace in Africa, Asia, the Middle East and across the globe.
He singled out ""dear Syria"", saying: ""How much blood has been shed! And how much suffering must there still be before a political solution is found?""
Easter is the most important festival in the Christian calendar and pilgrims have attended church across the world.
By David WilleyBBC News, Rome
In past years there have been two parts to the Pope's Easter message - a heartfelt appeal for peace in the world's trouble spots, and multilingual  greetings to the crowds thronging St Peter's Square.
There were 250,000 people from more than 100 countries present this morning.
But Pope Francis decided to cut the vernacular greetings.
He is, of course, most comfortable speaking his native Spanish, and he is also completely fluent in Italian as his family is from Piedmont in northern Italy.
Pope Francis was, however, almost incomprehensible when he tried out a few words in English to the crowds in St Peter's Square last week.
So he decided not to read out the  ""Happy Easter"" greetings that had been prepared for him in 65 different languages including difficult-to-pronounce oriental tongues.
Popes John Paul II and Benedict used to struggle to pronounce even a short phrase in Burmese,  Chinese or Korean, Pope Francis chose not even to try.
But his body language spoke volumes. He was completely at ease saluting families, kissing babies and tenderly embracing a young disabled man, as the Pope was driven in an open jeep around the packed square.
Pope Francis also speaks when he remains silent.
Pope Francis, formerly Buenos Aires Archbishop Jorge Mario Bergoglio, was elected on 13 March, becoming the first non-European pope for almost 1,300 years.
He replaced Benedict XVI, who held the office for eight years and became the first pontiff in more than 700 years to resign, saying he no longer had the physical strength to continue.
In his Urbi et Orbi (To the city and the world) speech, Pope Francis began with a simple ""Happy Easter!""
The 76-year-old Pope, who has begun his tenure by emphasising humility, went on: ""Christ has risen! What a joy it is for me to announce this message... I would like it to go out to every house and every family, especially where the suffering is greatest, in hospitals, in prisons.""
Later in his speech, Pope Francis said: ""We ask the risen Jesus, who turns death into life, to change hatred into love, vengeance into forgiveness, war into peace.""
The Pope then mentioned troubled regions of the world in turn.

""Peace for the Middle East, and particularly between Israelis and Palestinians, who struggle to find the road of agreement, that they may willingly and courageously resume negotiations to end a conflict that has lasted all too long.
""Peace in Iraq, that every act of violence may end, and above all for dear Syria, for its people torn by conflict and for the many refugees who await help and comfort.""
For Africa, the Pope referred to Mali, Nigeria - ""where attacks sadly continue"" - the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Central African Republic.
He added: ""Peace in Asia, above all on the Korean peninsula: may disagreements be overcome and a  renewed spirit of reconciliation grow.""

Pope Francis concluded by saying: ""Peace in the whole world, still divided by greed looking for easy gain, wounded by the selfishness which threatens human life and the family, selfishness that continues in human trafficking, the most extensive form of slavery in this 21st Century.""
BBC Rome correspondent, Alan Johnston, says the Pope has reinforced his image as a man of simple, down-to-earth tastes, not wearing the more ostentatious of papal costumes and, for the moment, not moving into the grandiose papal apartments.
One pilgrim in Rome on Sunday, Briton Tina Hughes, said that Francis represented a ""new beginning"".
""I think he brings something special. He connects with people. I feel good about him,"" she told Reuters.
In the days before Easter, the Pope had reached out to women and Muslims.
During a Holy Thursday Mass at a youth detention centre he washed and kissed the feet of 12 people, including two girls and two Muslims, and in a Good Friday procession referred to the ""friendship of our Muslim brothers and sisters"" in the Middle East.
But our correspondent says that, after Easter, the Pope will have to begin tackling the key issues facing the Catholic Church, such as reforming a Vatican bureaucracy riven by infighting and allegations of corruption, and tackling the issue of clerical sexual abuse.
Vatican watchers will also be keeping a keen eye on new appointments to key positions.
In his Easter homily, the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem, Fouad Twal, invited the Pope to visit.
The patriarch, the most senior Roman Catholic cleric in the Holy Land, also urged the international community to take ""concrete and effective decisions to find a balanced and just solution for the Palestinian cause, which lies at the heart of all the Middle East's troubles"".",Pope Francis has delivered a passionate plea for peace in his first Easter Sunday message since being elected.
352,"Cheshire East Council said ""deliberate and systematic manipulation"" took place from 2012 to 2014.
Cheshire Police is investigating whether any crimes were committed.
The council has apologised and said the falsified figures had caused ""serious problems"" in assessing applications for new developments.
""Serious"" errors in the council's air quality data readings, from 2012 to 2014, made them appear lower than they really were, an external investigation has revealed.
Falsified data ""may have affected"" decisions made on planning applications in Nantwich, Congleton, Crewe, Holmes Chapel and Sandbach, it concluded.
Emails seen by the BBC last month showed that auditors believed the number and nature of the inaccuracies meant human error was ""unlikely"" to have been responsible.
Sean Hannaby, the council's director of planning and sustainable development, said: ""We would like to assure everyone that we have done everything we can to rectify these failings.
""There are no immediate health protection measures needed as a result of these errors.""
Councillors have to decide if a development will:
All UK local authorities are obliged to monitor local air quality and submit their findings to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra).
Defra said the data provided ""an overview of pollution in locations where people are likely to be present and reveals historic trends which indicate whether policies to improve air quality are having the desired effect"".
Air pollutants include nitrogen dioxide from exhaust emissions which the government has been ordered to cut.
If a council does not meet national objectives it is obliged to declare an Air Quality Management Area and publish an action plan.
An internal review by Cheshire East Council auditors in 2016 found the air quality data submitted was different to the original data provided by the laboratory that analysed readings from the council's monitoring equipment.
The falsified data was from testing stations ""spread over a wide geographical area, which implies that the manipulation was not motivated by a wish to favour specific sites"", the council's report summary said.
Cheshire East Council has not commented on any potential disciplinary action.
A Defra spokesperson said: ""We are aware of this issue and understand the local authority is now considering its response to the investigation.""","Hundreds of planning applications are to be reviewed after a council admitted its air pollution data was ""falsified"" to make it look cleaner."
353,"It follows claims the social media giant had not done enough to tackle cyberbullies or extremists in the past.
In a blog, the firm said the new language emphasised it would ""not tolerate behaviour intended to harass or intimidate"".
It also said it had clarified what it considered to be ""abusive behaviour and hateful conduct"".
This includes:
The firm promised to suspend or close the accounts of users who ""cross the line into abuse"".
Pressure is growing on social media firms to tackle issues such as online extremism and cyberbullying, which are said to affect millions of young Britons every year.
The Times reported last week that the Home Secretary Theresa May had suggested that new surveillance powers - unveiled under the Investigatory Powers Bill - could be used to help police to unmask anonymous cyberbullies.
In a letter to MP James Cartlidge, seen by the paper, Ms May said: ""Internet connection records would update the capability of law enforcement in a criminal investigation to determine the sender and recipient of a communication.""
This could include ""a malicious message such as those exchanged in cyberbullying"".
Twitter has been criticised for not doing enough to tackle online abuse, and in February, then-chief executive Dick Costolo admitted the company ""sucks"" at dealing with trolling.
In its update, however, the firm said it had introduced a range of new protections in 2015, including new tools for reporting abusive behaviour and a ban on the ""promotion of terrorism"".
A spokesperson for the NSPCC, a child protection charity, said Twitter's new rules were ""a long overdue but very welcome step"".
""We have been urging social media companies to take decisive action to curb cyberbullying, which damages the lives of many children who tell us it is almost impossible to find a safe haven from it.
""Industry is now waking-up to this pernicious behaviour and it's good to some are taking a more proactive approach to dealing with it.""",Twitter has updated its rules to highlight it is taking a tougher stance against abuse.
354,"The event, entitled Shifting the Curve - Sharing the Challenge, is aimed at addressing the relatively static rates of breastfeeding in Scotland over the last decade.
Figures show 48.4% of babies were breastfed at around ten days old in 2013/14, compared with 44.4% in 2004/05.
The data shows a trend towards babies being fed both breast and formula milk, as well as a decline in breastfeeding by the six to eight week stage.
Experts in the field will come together to share the latest evidence on the benefits of breastfeeding, review what is working well and identify ways to drive up rates.
A key focus will be on increasing rates of breastfeeding in the most deprived areas in order to help reduce health inequalities.
Mothers in the wealthiest areas are nearly three times as likely to exclusively breastfeed at six to eight weeks, compared with those in the most deprived areas.
Public health minister Maureen Watt said: ""Breastfeeding has major health benefits, in the short and longer term, for both mother and baby. That is why the Scottish Government continues to promote it as the best source of nutrition for babies.
""We know it is important to understand the factors which influence a mother's infant feeding decision and develop effective strategies to encourage more women to breastfeed.
""Research shows that women who know about the health benefits of breastfeeding are more likely to start, therefore it's essential that in the antenatal period the health benefits of breastfeeding are discussed and explained to all women.""
Earlier this month, a study by Unicef concluded increasing the time women breastfeed could save the NHS millions of pounds by improving the health of mother and baby.
The summit will be held on 24 February at Murrayfield Stadium in Edinburgh.",Encouraging more women to breastfeed their babies will be the focus of a Scottish Government summit in the New Year.
355,"In a speech on Tuesday, Royal College of Physicians president Prof Jane Dacre will warn ministers the issue must be addressed if their policy is to work.
She will highlight research that shows vacant posts are not being filled and gaps in rotas are being seen.
It comes as ministers are locked in a dispute with junior doctors over their plans for improving weekend care.
Last week thousands of medics went on strike over the government's decision to impose a new contract on them, designed to make it cheaper to rota on staff at weekends.
Prof Dacre will raise her own concerns at the RCP's annual conference in Harrogate, saying NHS trusts are struggling to find enough staff to cope with existing demands.
Physicians are doctors who focus on diagnosis and treatment as opposed to surgery. They cover a whole range of areas including stroke and heart disease to the care of the elderly.
Research by the RCP showed last year there were just over 13,000 consultant physicians across the UK - one in four of all consultants.
But four in 10 vacant posts advertised last year went unfilled, while one in five consultants reported gaps in their junior doctor rotas.
Meanwhile, one in 10 consultants say they often have to carry out junior jobs to ensure patients' care is not harmed.
Prof Dacre will tell delegates: ""I feel sorry for NHS trusts, I really do. Across the country, they have created a raft of new posts to meet the rising demands for patient care, only to find that there is no-one to fill them.
""If we have neither enough trainees nor consultants to run the service now, how are we going to implement a safe seven-day service?""
She will go on to set out the case for extra funding, pointing out hospitals are racking up deficits and that funding lags behind other countries such as France and Germany.
""It is time to revisit our national contribution to healthcare,"" she will say.
But a Department of Health spokeswoman pointed out extra money was being invested during this Parliament - Â£8bn more by 2020.
She said this would help ""make sure the right staff and support is available to create a safe NHS seven days a week"".

Dr Richard Burden, senior physiologist at the English Institute of Sport, told the BBC in January that menstrual cycle research in sport was ""limited"".
The new study has been conducted by two London universities.
The Female Athlete Health Group - a collaborative project between St Mary's University and University College London - worked on two surveys, including one of London Marathon competitors.
Of the 1,862 women surveyed, including 90 who were considered elite level, 41.7% said their menstrual cycle affected their performance.
Nearly 44% met the criteria for heavy menstrual bleeding, but only 22.3% had sought help for period problems.
PhD student Georgie Bruinvels, who is leading the study, told BBC Sport: ""We feel like there are many unanswered questions when it comes to periods in sport.
""As a female athlete myself, I can see how much it impacts. So many elite coaches are male and it's hard for them to understand.
""It's this big taboo. I found that awareness is so poor and people don't know anything about it.
""By doing this research, we hope to raise more awareness and to encourage further examination of the subject.""

357,"President Rodrigo Duterte has said he wants to ""walk the extra mile"" to achieve peace, in a conflict which has claimed an estimated 30,000 lives since the 1960s. BBC Monitoring's Mark Wilson examines the challenges ahead.
The Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) began its armed struggle in the late 1960s. Its aim has been to overthrow the government through guerrilla warfare. The insurgency was established by academic, author and poet Jose Maria Sison.
The CPP's armed wing, the New People's Army (NPA), is believed to number around 4,000 fighters, down from a peak of 26,000 in the 1980s during the martial law era.
The NPA has engaged in killings, bombings and hostage-taking across the archipelago, collecting ""revolutionary taxes"" from businesses in the areas it controls.
Both the CPP and NPA were designated foreign terrorist organisations by the US government in 2002.
The rebels strongly oppose the US military presence in the Philippines and have in the past killed American service personnel stationed in the country.
Since the 1980s they have entered into talks with successive governments, but a peace deal has remained elusive.
Mr Duterte wants to end the insurgency and has said he is willing to ""walk the extra mile"" for peace.
He has tried to revive the peace process and has already held two rounds of formal discussions with the rebels since he took office last year.
The president has attempted to win the rebels' trust through a series of confidence-building measures. These include appointing rebel sympathisers to his cabinet, releasing high-ranking rebels from prison and offering land to NPA members if talks succeed.
The rebels have reciprocated by releasing police officers they were holding hostage.
Both sides have also separately declared a series of unilateral ceasefires, but are yet to agree a joint ceasefire deal.
The ceasefires have been marred by the killings of soldiers and rebels.
Government officials accused the CPP of being unable to control its armed wing after four soldiers were killed in an NPA landmine attack in July.
The attack led Mr Duterte to temporarily lift the government ceasefire.
Days later, an NPA rebel was killed in a battle with the military in Surigao del Norte province.
The rebels, who say they will not give up arms even if a deal is reached, have accused the military of using Mr Duterte's drug war as a pretext to mount operations in rebel areas amid the ceasefire.
A real sticking point in recent months has been the issue of freeing around 400 detained rebels.
The CPP demands that the government grant a general amnesty to these rebels as part of negotiations.
After Mr Duterte refused, insisting that the rebels must first agree to a joint ceasefire deal, the rebels accused him of ""capriciously changing his mind"" on the issue.
Since the last round of talks in October, the rebels have also taken issue with some of Mr Duterte's policies at home and abroad.
They have criticised both his warming relations with Russia and China and his move to allow a hero's burial for late dictator Ferdinand Marcos.
At the forthcoming talks on 18 January, to be held in Rome, the two sides will aim to reach a bilateral ceasefire deal.
That the talks have got this far demonstrates the desire for peace on both sides, but delays in granting amnesties to detained rebels is threatening to derail negotiations.
Wide ranging rebel-proposed social and economic reforms, which the CPP has described as the core of the talks, are also still to be agreed.",The Philippines government is due to begin peace talks with communist rebels on 18 January which could end one of Asia's longest insurgencies.

359,"Powys council's cabinet said the loss of £1.6m over the next three years has affected the number of classes it could afford and it was launching a review.
It will look at whether its sixth forms are financially viable and educationally sustainable.
The Welsh government said it is working with Powys to minimise the impact of cuts to learning.
The council launched a similar review three years ago but eventually decided not to shut any sixth forms in the county.
Since then, the council has backed the takeover of the struggling John Beddoes School in Presteigne by Newtown High School, meaning the number of sixth forms in the county will drop from 13 to 12 from April.
Council cabinet member for learning Myfanwy Alexander said: ""Changes to the way post-16 funding is delivered and a decline in pupil numbers have had a severe impact on Powys sixth forms.
""Learner choice will be hit hard and the sustainability of Powys sixth forms will be seriously affected.""
In September 2012, the council was able to fund 232 further education classes across the authority area.
But according to the council, the decline in pupil numbers and changes to post-16 education budgets means only 181 classes will be funded in September 2014.
Ms Alexander said she feared a ""reduced menu of subjects"" for pupils, leading to some students travelling outside of Powys to study.
She said the education authority had made ""strong representations"" to the Welsh government on the funding changes, and had asked for a rethink on funding levels or risk ""damaging changes in Powys"".
Responding to the council's comments, the Welsh government's deputy minister for skills and technology Ken Skates said: ""We have been open about the stark reality of the financial challenges ahead and the difficult decisions that we are facing.
""The post-16 sector remains a key priority for this government and we are working closely with colleagues in Powys and across Wales to minimise the impact of any reductions on learning.""
Controversial plans to save around £20m was approved by councillors in Powys last week. The decision also means about 400 posts will be lost at the authority.",Some secondary school sixth forms in Powys could be at risk following a 10% cut in post-16 education funding.
360,"Brent crude ended Thursday 0.4% higher at $49.94 a barrel.
Prices initially fell but then reversed course when figures showed that US crude stockpiles had fallen in the past week.
In a statement, Opec said its members were committed to a ""stable and balanced oil market"".
Speaking after the meeting, Saudi Arabia pledged that it would not flood the market by increasing production.
The country's energy minister, Khalid Al-Falih, said: ""We will be very gentle in our approach and make sure we don't shock the market in anyway.""
Opec members produce 40% of the world's crude oil.
A meeting of most Opec members, along with other oil exporters including Russia, similarly failed to cap output following a meeting in Qatar in April.
John Hall, an oil analyst with alfaenergy, said: ""Now that there is a realisation that Opec will not be restricting output, traders are caught long with too much oil in a falling market and so once $50 had been reached, there was a general mood to sell off rapidly.""
After peaking at about $115 a barrel in the summer of 2014, the price of oil fell steadily to a low of about $27 in January this year due to a combination of weaker demand and increased supply.
Opec secretary-general Abdulla al-Badri denied that the failure to cap output meant that the cartel was dead: ""Opec will be powerful, will be strong. Opec is alive.""
Bob Minter, analyst at Aberdeen Asset Management Investment, said: ""This should have been an easy meeting to re-establish Opec relevance, but they missed the opportunity.""
The oil ministers did agree that Nigeria's Mohammed Sanusi Barkindo would become Opec's new secretary-general from 1 August.
The decision ended years of dispute between Saudi Arabia and Iran, which had put forward their own candidates and refused to agree on a compromise.
The ministers also agreed to admit Gabon as the 14th member of Opec from next month.",The price of oil rose slightly despite a meeting of the Opec oil producers' group failing to set a cap on the amount of oil the group produces.
361,"With the game pointless, England hooker Hartley lashed out at Tigers' Matt Smith with just 17 minutes gone.
Tigers registered a penalty try, but after the break Alex Waller and Ben Foden went over for the champions and Niki Goneva scored two of his own.
But with three minutes left Jamie Elliott touched down to win an epic derby at Franklin's Gardens.
It was all in spite of Saints captain Hartley's indiscretion, the latest on a growing rap sheet throughout his career which will raise questions about his credentials to represent England, regardless of whether his inevitable ban stretches into next year's Six Nations.
With two separate brawls having broken out on the pitch, replays showed that Hartley's elbow connected with Smith's chin during a scuffle, and referee JP Doyle took the advice of the television match official to send off the 28-year-old.
After missing last year's British & Irish Lions tour of Australia with an 11-week ban after being dismissed for swearing at referee Wayne Barnes in the 2013 Premiership final - also against the Tigers - Hartley, by his own admission, was in the last chance saloon when it came to his England career.
The New Zealand-born forward, who rejected a big-money move to Montpellier to sign a new Saints deal this week, can also count a 26-week ban in 2007 for eye gouging and eight-week and two-week bans in 2012, for biting and striking respectively, among his misdemeanours.
With just 17 minutes having passed when he trudged off the field, Saints, like in the 2013 final, were once again without their captain and facing an uphill battle.
Immediately after Hartley's sending off, which inevitably overshadowed a typically ferocious East Midlands derby, things got worse for Saints who, still trying to regroup, conceded a penalty try for impeding three consecutive scrums.
Owen Williams slotted the conversion and Stephen Myler put over a penalty for Saints, before Tigers' Tom Croft was sin-binned moments before the break for a high tackle.
Myler collected the points off the tee and after the interval Saints capitalised on Croft's absence, pinning Tigers back into their 22 and freeing up Salesi Ma'afu to pass on to Waller for the score.
Tom Youngs, who may be eyeing up Hartley's place in Stuart Lancaster's England side, lasted less than 50 minutes as he continued his return from injury, but Tigers were able to reassert themselves when they were back up to their full quota.
Replacement Freddie Burns's break down the middle had Saints scrambling under their posts and Leicester quickly recycled as Goneva crossed after taking a pass from Williams, who skewed his conversion wide.
Fourteen-man Saints once again validated their status as champions and Premiership leaders, though, when Luther Burrell, who was a powerhouse all afternoon, burst forward, allowing the ball to go through the hands to Foden for a superb finish from 35 metres.
It looked like it might be to no avail as Tigers, unbeaten in four Premiership games coming into the match, turned it over in midfield through Julian Salvi and put Goneva over in the corner.
But, remarkably, Saints found time for one more push and, from a line-out, swept the ball across the pitch for Elliott to clinch an unlikely and thrilling victory.

""At half-time Tom Wood said 'let's do it for Dylan'.
""It was a tremendous, spirited performance. Not just relying on spirit and guts but also a lot of technical and tactical work.
""In terms of the red card it is disappointing. Dylan has to keep his arms down but he's being held and I don't think there is any malice in it. The nature of the game didn't justify a red card. I think Smith went down pretty easily, which was disappointing.
""I think the referee's initial decision of a yellow card would have been the correct decision.

362,"The Markit/CIPS services purchasing managers' index (PMI) stood at 52.6, down from August's 52.9, but above the 50 level which indicates expansion.
On Monday, the manufacturing sector recorded its best PMI for two years.
Markit said the latest findings cast doubt on the need for more stimulus action from the Bank of England.
The surveys, which are calculated by speaking to purchasing professionals and business decision-makers across a range of companies, are seen as an early indication of how the economy is performing, since they are released before official GDP data.
""The survey results suggest that the economy has regained modest growth momentum since the EU referendum, with especially strong growth appearing in manufacturing,"" said Markit's chief business economist Chris Williamson.
""The risk of recession in the second half of 2016 has therefore all but evaporated, and the solid PMI readings for September will cast doubt on the need for any further stimulus from the Bank of England in coming months.""
July's survey had shown a steep drop in business activity in the immediate wake of the referendum, but that started to recover in August. In addition, September's survey indicated that new business in services rose at the fastest pace since February and that the rate of job creation had picked up.
However, Mr Williamson pointed out that the pace of expansion had cooled since the beginning of the year, ""reflecting widespread concern about the potential future impact of Brexit"".
Official growth figures for the second quarter were revised up to 0.7% last week, by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), from an initial reading of 0.6%.
Pantheon Economics agreed that the Bank of England would probably refrain from cutting rates in November but predicted growth would continue to slow in the coming months, ""as firms hold back from hiring and investment due to 'hard' Brexit risk and households' real incomes are squeezed by rising inflation"".
The PMI survey showed that services firms reported the fastest rate of input price inflation since February 2013 in September, with providers subsequently raising their charges at the fastest rate since January 2014.
The services industry - which includes everything from financial advice to retailers - accounts for about three-quarters of the UK economy.","The UK services sector continued to recover last month, after a sharp drop in activity following the Brexit vote, according to a closely watched survey."

364,"The Welsh government pays the majority of Welsh students' tuition fees, wherever they choose to go in the UK.
On Monday, Universities Wales will publish its manifesto ahead of next year's Assembly elections calling for the current tuition fee grant to be replaced by a means tested grant.
The Welsh government said its policy was an ""investment in young people"".
University Wales's chairman Prof Colin Riordan said means testing would be fairer.
He told BBC Wales' Sunday Politics programme: ""You could decide to spend the resource equally and thinly or you can say 'let's focus on the areas of most need' - so those people who come from disadvantaged backgrounds, perhaps, or areas which need support such as expensive subjects"".
Universities have long argued the grant means tens of millions of pounds leaves the higher education sector in Wales and goes to the coffers of their counterparts in England.
Prof Riordan added: ""Means testing would mean that those students who really need support would get it.
""Those who are more able to support themselves would be able to do that. That's surely fair.""
Earlier this month the UK government's Universities Minister Jo Johnson said institutions in England would be allowed to raise their fees in future if they can demonstrate a high quality of teaching.
But Prof Riordan said it ""would add cost to the tuition fee grant in ways that could become quite unsustainable"".
The tuition fee grant has faced criticism from many involved with Higher Education in Wales.
Earlier this year, the head of the body responsible for allocating funding to universities in Wales said the Welsh government needs to change how it funds students from Wales to avoid universities here falling behind their English counterparts.
In 2013, BBC Wales revealed the body representing universities here had concerns they were losing out compared to their counterparts in England because of the tuition fee grant.
BBC Wales has also revealed concerns expressed by the finance directors of universities in Wales that the grant left the sector ""with an uncertain financial future"".
In November 2013, the Welsh government announced a review of higher education funding and student finance arrangements in Wales, which is chaired by the Scottish academic, Professor Ian Diamond.
Prof Diamond will make some of his thoughts public later this year, with the full review expected to be published after the Assembly elections in May next year.
A Welsh government spokesperson said: ""Our tuition fee policy is an investment in young people.
""Over the course of a three year undergraduate degree, current students from Wales are around Â£17,000 better off than their English counterparts.
""The Diamond review of higher education and student finance in Wales is ongoing. Once published, it will inform the next steps for higher education funding in Wales.""","The way Welsh students are funded is unsustainable, the body representing universities in Wales has said."

366,"In an emergency statement at Holyrood, he apologised to rail passengers who have been affected by disruption.
It came on the day commuters faced severe disruption after overhead wiring problems affected services in Glasgow.
ScotRail declared a major incident after finding a broken insulator between Partick and Glasgow Central.
The rail operator said the issue caused disruption and cancellations between Glasgow Central and Dalmuir, Milngavie and Maryhill.
There has been widespread criticism of the reliability of ScotRail trains since Abellio took over the franchise.
Abellio has said the terms of the contract meant government ministers were responsible for overcrowding on the network.
In the Scottish Parliament, Mr Yousaf admitted that ScotRail's performance was not ""up to scratch"" but he said it was higher than the UK average.
He also outlined a series of actions and investments Scotrail will make.
They include an earlier commuter service between Inverness and the central belt, which will begin in mid-December, and the addition of carriages to peak services on the Borders Railway in a bid to reduce overcrowding.
The minister said: ""Everyone rightly expects a railway network that operates effectively. So when things go wrong I fully understand the dissatisfaction of passengers and the inconvenience that is caused.
""Although there are no guarantees major failures won't happen, I give my reassurance that ScotRail has learned lessons and is far better prepared for contingencies, including communication with passengers, when such incidents do take place.""
He added: ""I know about the work that is required and the service that is to be delivered. I am taking action and a plan is now in place. This government has a track record of delivering for our railways and it is my firm intention that we will continue to do so.""
In his statement, Mr Yousaf also highlighted:
ScotRail was ordered to produce a performance improvement plan in September after punctuality and reliability fell below the expected standard.
At Holyrood, the minister faced calls to publish the plan in full from Liberal Democrat Mike Rumbles.
Mr Yousaf agreed to speak to ScotRail about its publication in the interests of ""accountability and transparency"".
Scottish Labour's transport spokesman Neil Bibby said the rail service has become worse since the improvement plan was demanded.
He added: ""His handling of the rail crisis has seen him fall out with Abellio, Network Rail and the transport unions.
""Humza Yousaf claims he's not a transport expert - and he's right. Humza Yousaf must ditch the spin and publish his 246 point improvement plan in full.""
Murdo Fraser, of the Scottish Conservatives, said it was time the government started taking responsibility for the railways' poor performance.
The latest performance data showed 86% of ScotRail trains were on time or less than five minutes late between 16 October and 12 November, with wide variations in reliability across the country.
ScotRail's figures remained better than the average for all UK train operators - with the company also enjoying better than average customer satisfaction figures when the latest data was published earlier this year.
But Abellio's contract to run the ScotRail franchise requires the company to ensure 91.3% of trains arrive within five minutes of schedule.
The Scottish government can cancel the contract if performance drops to 84.3% for three months in a row.","Transport Minister Humza Yousaf has told MSPs that ""ScotRail has learned lessons"" following a series of problems on Scotland's railways."

After crawling for three-quarters of a mile (1.2km), he was found by his wife who had become concerned for his welfare.
A coastguard statement said it was ""quite an ordeal"" for Mr Robinson.
The coastguard said Mr Robinson had been walking on rocks on the western end of the beach at about 16:30 GMT when he slipped and injured his leg.
With no means of calling for help, he dragged himself off the rocks back on to the beach and then crawled in the darkness towards Seatown.
He was eventually discovered by his wife who had gone to look for him and she raised the alarm. The couple, from the Derby area, were on holiday in Bridport.
The coastguard rescue team saw ""faint torch lights"" on the beach and crew from an RNLI lifeboat swam ashore to reach Mr Robinson.
With a rescue helicopter unavailable due to fog, he was transferred on to the lifeboat and taken to Lyme Regis from where he was taken by ambulance to hospital in Dorchester.
Mr Robinson, who is a full-time member of the Territorial Army, said: ""I just slipped on a rock and have two fractures of the right leg. Everyone who helped me was just terrific.""
RNLI helmsman Jon Broome said: ""His military background came to the fore. He found some sticks and used them to get to the beach. He then crawled on his hands and knees for a good two hours.

The federal statistics office retained its growth forecast for the year ending in March 2017 at 7.1%.
The figures surprised economists, who had expected the economy to take a bigger hit from Prime Minister Narendra Modi's decision last November to withdraw old 500-rupee and 1,000-rupee banknotes, taking 86% of the currency out of circulation virtually overnight.

Selby's IBF featherweight world title defence against Jonathan Victor Barros in Las Vegas was called off on Friday.
The Welshman has said Carl Frampton and Abner Mares, the regular WBA champion, could be future opponents.
""Selby's not really had that one big fight which can make him that name,"" Khan told BBC Wales Sport.
""I think beating someone like Abner Mares or someone like [Leo] Santa Cruz or Frampton would definitely take him to a different level.
""They're big names in the world of boxing and [some] have titles so, definitely by beating one of those big names, Selby would be right up there.
""I think Selby has the talent to do it. He's a prospect to keep an eye on in the future.""
Selby's third defence of his IBF world title was meant to take place on the undercard of Frampton's WBA featherweight title bout with Mexico's Leo Santa Cruz at the MGM Grand.
If he had beaten Barros, Selby was planning to challenge Frampton - with the Northern Irishman saying he would like the fight to take place at Belfast's Windsor Park.

The abandonment of Selby's fight against Barros could delay those plans but, whenever it may happen, it is a fight Khan would like to see materialise.

373,"NHS Health Scotland found that a ban on multi-buy drinks promotions was among a number of successful initiatives.
However, it warned that more needed to be done to ensure the improvements continued, including the introduction of a minimum price for alcohol.
The report is the final review of the Scottish government's alcohol strategy, which was introduced in 2009.
Before then, high and increasing levels of alcohol consumption were closely linked to increasing alcohol harm.
Studies had shown that alcohol may have caused the deaths of one in 20 of the Scots who died in 2003.
And half of Scotland's prisoners said they were drunk when they committed their offence.
The government's ""framework for action"" outlined 41 steps to reduce alcohol consumption, and support families and communities.
A key policy - a minimum price for alcohol - has not been introduced because it is subject to a legal challenge by the Scotch Whisky Association.
Clare Beeston, from NHS Health Scotland, said the country continued to ""pay a heavy price"" for high levels of alcohol consumption.
She added: ""The picture has improved but levels of alcohol-related harm remain high - on average 22 people in Scotland die every week because of alcohol.""
She warned that the decline in alcohol consumption and harm may have slowed or stalled recently.
""We need to continue to push for the most effective ways to reduce the amount of alcohol Scotland drinks,"" she said.
""These are to reduce the affordability, availability and promotion of alcohol.
""A minimum unit price for alcohol is one of the best ways to reduce drinking in the heaviest drinkers and tackle the alcohol related health inequalities.""
The report highlighted the success of several parts of the strategy:
It also found that external factors, such as a fall in disposable income, were likely to have had an impact on alcohol trends.
Public Health Minister Maureen Watt said:  ""We have seen reductions in alcohol-related harm and this is of course welcome.
""However, harm rates are still higher than they were 20 years ago and higher than in England and Wales, so now is not the time to be complacent.""
She added: ""The report also recognises that a key element of the alcohol framework - minimum unit pricing - has yet to be implemented due to a legal challenge from parts of the alcohol industry and this has impacted on the progress made.
""Given the link between consumption and harm, and evidence that affordability is a key driver of increased consumption, addressing price is an important element of any long-term strategy to tackle alcohol misuse and, as such, we remain committed to introducing minimum unit pricing.""",A new report has found that government policies have had a positive impact on alcohol consumption in Scotland.
374,"Charlotte Foster, from Telford, died in January after a thrombosis caused a ""massive"" embolism in her lungs.
A GP who saw her three weeks before noted no signs of thrombosis.
Miss Foster's mother told the coroner the GP thought the problem was ""mechanical"" and recommended a massage.
The 23 year old died in hospital three days after collapsing at her workplace.
Celia Foster told the inquest at Shropshire Coroner's Court, her daughter had heart palpitations and had messaged her family on New Year's Eve to say her ribs hurt and that she could not lie down or breathe properly.
She said she accompanied her daughter to an appointment with GP Sunil Simon at his practice in Newport on 4 January.
She said her daughter was angry after the consultation, as he ""did not seem to listen to her"" and suggested she go for a massage or a spa day, despite her complaining of leg and back pain and tightness in her chest.
In his evidence to the hearing, Dr Simon said he had ""no concerns"" during the appointment that Miss Foster had been suffering from a pulmonary embolism.
""When I observed Miss Foster during that day, I did not note any signs of respiratory distress or shortness of breath. She did not display any signs of a pulmonary embolism of a deep vein thrombosis,"" he said.
Miss Foster went into cardiac arrest at work and died at Telford's Princess Royal Hospital on 25 January.
She had been given a three-month prescription of Dianette as a contraceptive and to combat acne in August 2015, having advised her GP of a family history of pulmonary embolism and breast cancer.
She then returned to see a different GP at her surgery in Newport in October and was given a continuing prescription for the drug, having reported no side effects.
Dr Nigel Tuft, a consultant at the Princess Royal Hospital, told the hearing that CT scans had shown she was not suffering from any tumours likely to have caused the pulmonary embolism.
He said he had multiple discussions with her family following her death, and had concluded her only risk factor was that she was taking the oral contraceptive.
Dr Tuft told the inquest: ""The most likely site for the pulmonary embolism to arise is in the veins of the pelvis and the upper leg. These can cause no symptoms whatsoever or they can cause symptoms or deep vein thrombosis.""

Kurdish military sources in north-eastern Syria told me that Mr Scurfield was killed when the armoured vehicle he was in was hit by a missile launched by the Islamic State militants.
The special mobile guerrilla unit which Mr Scurfield was part of came under attack during an offensive against IS to recapture areas around Til Hamis town in Hasakah province.
Kurdish Popular Protection Units (YPG) forces have recovered his body along with other casualties, and brought the body to Derik, a town in north-eastern corner of Syria, close to Iraqi border.
He joined the YPG, a secular group that has proven to be very effective against IS in Syria and Iraq, on 7 December. The Kurdish sources say that in a video, which is not publicly available yet, Mr Scurfield says he ""joined the YPG to fight against IS"".
Mr Jarvis, who is Labour MP for Barnsley Central, called on the government to monitor all British citizens who travel to Iraq and Syria to join the fight against IS.
""There have been several reports of other British civilians doing the same thing, but the government confirmed when I recently raised this issue in Parliament that there is currently no system to monitor or record people going to the region with the aim of joining the fight against Isis,"" he said.
""I wrote to the Foreign Office regarding this issue some weeks ago and will be now following up that letter.""
In a statement, the Foreign Office said: ""The UK has advised for some time against all travel to Syria, where all UK consular services are suspended.
""As we do not have any representation in Syria it is extremely difficult to get any confirmation of deaths or injuries and our options for supporting British nationals there are extremely limited.""

More than 500 Britons are believed to have travelled to join IS.
BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner said the UK government's position was ""probably going to lead to accusations of double standards"".

Mr Hurley was filmed tied to a chair in the Dowdalls' garage as Jonathan Dowdall, who was wearing a balaclava, put a tea towel on his face and poured buckets of water over him.
Patrick Dowdall took out pliers and threatened to pull off the victim's fingers, starting with the smallest.

He said it would counteract the Army School of the Americas in Georgia which trained US allies during the Cold War.
Some of its graduates committed serious human rights abuses in the region.
The new academy is based in the city of Santa Cruz in eastern Bolivia and will initially take 100 recruits.
Speaking at the opening ceremony, Bolivia's Defence Minister Reymi Ferreira said: ""The School of Anti-Imperialism is a school that seeks to preserve life, unlike the School of the Americas, which brainwashed military officers into believing that the enemy was our people.""
He said the training centre would seek to help soldiers identify key threats to the country's national sovereignty.
Since his inauguration in 2005, President Morales has had a relationship with the US which has been at times very tense.
In 2008 he expelled the US ambassador and counter-narcotics agent and more recently he has accused accusing Washington of encouraging ""congressional coups"" such as the impending impeachment trial of suspended President Dilma Rousseff in Brazil.
He has also accused the US of promoting global terrorism through military interventions, citing the rise of the Islamic State group as an example.
In Latin America, some officers trained at the US-based School of the Americas went on to commit some of the worse human rights abuses in the region.
They include two of the Argentinean military officers who led the junta in the late 1970s.  Human rights organisations say the military government killed around 30,000 left-wing opponents during their administration.
The former Guatemalan President, General Efraim Rios Montt, also trained at  the School of the Americas in the 1950s.

381,"Richard Tutt, head of Magna Academy in Poole, told the BBC the technique would only be used in cases where pupils are on the verge of permanent exclusion.
It was part of a much wider system, he said, where pupils are rewarded with points which they can use to buy items.
But some parents accused the school of humiliating or bullying pupils.
Mr Tutt, who took over the secondary modern four years ago, said his students were rewarded far more than they were punished.
""This needs to be taken in a far wider context. We have a very well established behaviour sanction and reward system,"" he said, adding that behaviour was impeccable at the academy.
This included an online reward system, where students received points for good behaviour, which could be used to buy things like nail manicures or footballs.
Pupils at the school, 40% of whom are classed as disadvantaged, are also rewarded with free coffees or by being allowed to go to the front of the lunch queue, Mr Tutt said, as well as usual status positions, such as being made prefects.
One Facebook post, from Jodi Taylor, said: ""My god-daughter goes to this school and this is just a few of the things they threaten.
""She is frightened to go to school and she is a good girl. It is nothing short of bullying, the good kids are being treated as bad and been threatened on a daily basis.
""School is meant to be a fun part of growing up?""
A parent, also writing on Facebook, said that the idea was an ""absolute disgrace"", adding: ""My boys go to this school. If they try that with my boys I will seek legal action.""
Mr Tutt said the assembly apology sanction was reserved for extreme cases and had not yet been used.
""It is to deal with repeat offenders who have received fixed term exclusions. The type of behaviour being punished might include being in complete defiance of a teacher or physical violence.
""And bear in mind we are a school in a challenging environment and we want them to learn.""
He said there had been a very small minority of parents who did not sign up to the idea.
A letter to parents said: ""Any student whose behaviour disrupts the learning of others will be expected to stand up at the front in their faculty assembly, face their peers, and apologise to the whole faculty for letting them down.
It also says: ""As from now, if any student receives a repeat fixed term external exclusion then, as part of our reintegration process, their parent(s)/carer(s) will be expected to sit next to them in lessons and to supervise them at break and lunchtime, for the day following the exclusion.
""This will help students, whose poor behaviour has caused them to be excluded, settle back into lessons and academy life.""
Mr Tutt said students at risk of being excluded were offered a range of support and given pastoral care, because the school did everything it could to avoid permanent exclusions.

383,"An Ipsos MRBI opinion poll for The Irish Times suggests the odds of a hung Dáil (parliament) are increasing.
The survey indicates a drop in support for Labour and Sinn Féin, with Fianna Fáil and Independents improving their position.
The figures would mean an indecisive result if it was replicated on polling day.
The poll shows no change in Fine Gael support since the election campaign began and a drop in Labour Party support to just 6%.
Fianna Fáil has moved up two percentage points to 23%, Sinn Féin is down four points to 15%, according to the poll.
There appear to be significant gains for independents and smaller parties, who are up three points to 28%.

""The crew of the ship acted provocatively and aggressively, which concerned the operators of monitoring stations and ships of the Black Sea Fleet,"" according to a military source quoted by Russian state media.
""Su-24 attack aircraft demonstrated to the American crew readiness to harshly prevent a violation of the frontier and to defend the interests of the country.""

388,"The team's technique involves building a 3D image of a patient's brain in a matter of minutes.
Strokes occur about 152,000 times a year in the UK, according to the Stroke Association.
In Scotland, NHS Scotland considers strokes to be the third commonest cause of death.
When a stroke happens speed is of the essence. First in diagnosing what kind of stroke it is, then treating it.
That is because there are two main types - ischemic and haemorrhagic - and two very different ways of treating them.
Both MRI and CT scanners can provide an image of the brain and the damage done, but are big and expensive. Patients have to come to them.
The mathematicians envisage a new type of detector small enough to ride in an ambulance.
It will be a helmet containing microwave antennae, and will fire the microwave through the patient's brain and receive the resulting signals.
The results will be sent to a supercomputing centre, which is where the maths comes in.
The techniques developed at Strathclyde and on the continent can produce a 3D image of the brain - and its injury - within 15 minutes.
The sensor hardware is being developed by the Austrian imaging company EMTensor.
At the moment it exists as two prototypes in a hospital in Vienna.
Each is a cylindrical chamber consisting of five rings, each of 32 antennae.
The next step will be to make the device portable.
One of the mathematics team is Dr Victorita Dolean, a Reader in Strathclyde's Department of Mathematics and Statistics.
""Our aim will be to produce a portable and less expensive device that can detect strokes in real time,"" she says.
""The idea would be that we'd send these electromagnetic waves into the brain and then the properties of the tissues - which will be healthy or sick - will be detected by measurements of the data on this helmet.
""The data will be sent to a supercomputing centre.
""We have designed some open source software that is able to reconstruct, precisely and in real time, an image of the brain and then send it back to the doctors to interpret this data and make the diagnosis.""
The team's mathematical approach has already won the team the Bull-Joseph Fourier Prize for excellence in numerical simulation and data processing.
""We could not have done this a few years ago because we needed powerful advances in electronics, in computer science, in algorithms, in mathematics,"" Dr Dolean says.
She now expects the sensor helmets to be in the field in two to four years - not just in ambulances, but anywhere they might be needed.
""They'll be cheap and portable and able to act as an emergency device,"" she says.
And that quick, on the spot diagnosis could mean survival for stroke victims.","An international team of mathematicians, including one from Strathclyde University, has developed a method to speed up stroke diagnosis."

390,"The Welsh government is more than halfway through a £4.6m five-year programme to immunise badgers in north Pembrokeshire.
Infection rates have fallen across Wales, but Christianne Glossop said it was too early to say whether it has had ""additional benefit"".
Dr Glossop was speaking ahead of a worldwide conference on TB control.
It will be held in Cardiff on Monday.
""The programme is for five years,"" she told BBC's Sunday Politics Wales.
""We've completed two years and we're now well into year three, and so the results are by no means available yet.""
TB infection rates fell across Wales over the last 12 months, she said.
""The reduction in north Pembrokeshire is in line with the national reduction, so right now, we have no evidence that the vaccination programme in badgers is delivering an additional benefit - and we wouldn't expect to see any evidence at this stage either,"" she said.
In 2012 and 2013, 2,776 badgers were trapped and vaccinated in the Intensive Action Area (IAA), which also takes in parts of Ceredigion and Carmarthenshire, at a cost of more than £1.8m.
But Dr Glossop said that the wider TB eradication programme cost £28m last year alone, most of which was spent on testing cattle, biosecurity and compensating farmers.
""You've always got to have the balance here between all the different elements of the programme, making sure that you're tackling all sources of infection,"" she said.
The vaccination programme was announced by Labour ministers in 2012 when they abandoned the previous coalition government's intention to cull badgers in the IAA.","It is unclear whether vaccinating badgers in west Wales has cut TB in cattle, the chief vet has said."

Johnson added: ""When I joined the region I had a remit to help set-up systems that would enable us to bring through home grown talent, coaches and players, a challenge I've thoroughly enjoyed getting my teeth into over the last three years.
""I feel that now is the right time for me to move on to other challenges but I remain 100% committed to the Ospreys between now and the end of the season.""
The real legacy he [Johnson] will leave is the systems and structures he has helped to develop that will allow us to continue leading the way in Wales
Johnson's role with Scotland is thought to also include some involvement with Glasgow and Edinburgh.
Ospreys chief operations officer Andrew Hore said: ""It is a huge disappointment for us to be losing Scott at the end of the season, but we understand that he feels it is the right time for him to move on to other challenges having served the three years he committed himself to us for originally.""
Hore added: ""By informing us of his intentions at this early stage, it allows us to use this time to consider our next course of action and the options available to us as we plan for the future.""
Managing director Roger Blyth said: ""While he has brought silverware to the Liberty Stadium and we hope that will be the case once again this season, the real legacy he will leave is the systems and structures he has helped to develop that will allow us to continue leading the way in Wales.""
Johnson joined the Ospreys ahead of the 2009-10 season, leaving the role of USA Eagles national coach to do so.
He first arrived in Wales as a skills coach during 2011 World Cup winning coach Graham Henry's reign and was assistant coach during the Steve Hansen and Mike Ruddock eras.
Wales won their first Grand Slam in 27 years under Ruddock in 2005 and many credited Johnson with playing a key role in that achievement.
Johnson became Wales caretaker coach during the 2006 Six Nations following Ruddock's controversial departure.
In March 2006 Johnson became one of John Connolly's assistant coaches and selectors ahead of the Wallabies' 2007 World Cup campaign.
In 2008 he became USA coach and left the following year to return to Wales with the Ospreys.
During his time at the Liberty Stadium, they reached the 2009-10 Heineken Cup quarter-finals where they were defeated 29-28 by Biarritz.
A year later they bowed out after a tough pool stage featuring Munster, Toulon and London Irish and this term are struggling in the competition having drawn 26-26 in Treviso and lost back-to-back games against Saracens in Pool Five.
In what was the Magners League, the Ospreys' greatest triumph came in Johnson's first Ospreys term, a 17-12 win over Leinster in Dublin in the tournament's inaugural Grand Final.
Ahead of the 2011-12 season they lost high-profile players James Hook, Lee Byrne, Jerry Collins, Marty Holah and Mike Phillips and were without a glut of Test stars playing for Wales, Ireland, Scotland and Samoa at the World Cup.
But after a strong start in what is now the Pro12 League, the Ospreys lie second to Leinster with eight wins from 11 games.
Wasps coach Dai Young and Johnson coached the Barbarians when they beat Wales in June, 2011.
Johnson was Wales' observer of Sir Clive Woodward's British and Irish Lions back-room staff during the ill-fated 2005 tour to New Zealand.
Scotland coach Robinson was a Woodward assistant on that tour and has sought someone of the right calibre to be his right-hand man.
""I am delighted Scott has agreed to join the Scotland coaching team. I have huge respect for him as a coach and a person having coached against him on numerous occasions,"" Robinson said.
At the 2011 World Cup Scotland failed to reach the quarter-finals for the first time and Robinson is keen to emulate the template that brought the All Blacks success at the tournament.
Graham Henry had Test-hardened coaches in former Wales coach Steve Hansen and ex-All Blacks head coach Wayne Smith as his assistants.
Johnson's solicitor, Duncan Sandlant, of Esportif international, had indicated that Scotland was not his only option, saying: ""Scott has a number of options which he is seriously considering.""
The Australian had been linked in reports in New Zealand with a role as assistant to new All Blacks head coach Hansen.

The Briton, 31, told BBC Sport: ""Not a good day for me. Probably the worst session I've ever had in qualifying.""
Hamilton, who is defending the drivers' title, said he would ""have to think about"" what had gone wrong.

""I was 0.4secs up on both laps so there is no question of whether I was quick enough. I just didn't finish the laps. The car was very good yesterday. We made some changes and it wasn't as good today. I wasn't able to brake in the same places and I made too many mistakes.""
Hamilton faces a race of damage limitation to his title hopes, as Rosberg, who is nine points ahead in the championship, is likely to run away in the lead, such is the level of Mercedes' dominance around the demanding new 3.7-mile street track in the Azerbaijani capital, Baku.
""P10 is going to be horrible as it always is around street circuits,"" Hamilton said.
""I don't know what I can do from there but I need to try to get as many points as I can.
""Finishing the race is important and not allowing Nico to pull too far away. Hopefully I can stay out of trouble.

The rules say a driver must start the race on the set of tyres on which he set his fastest time in Q2, but Hamilton's were damaged because he locked them up.
If there is a safety issue they can be changed at the FIA's discretion, which would almost certainly be granted.
Hamilton said: ""All my tyres are flat-spotted so I have no idea what they are going to do.""
However, he said he was optimistic he could still have a good race.
""If I don't get caught up in other people's mistakes, good points are still possible. It's not impossible I could win.""

Rosberg said: ""One of the more challenging sessions out there but everything worked out well.
""There was a bit of reorganising because in Q3 Lewis had an off in front of me and I had to abort that lap and do one more at the end. But it worked out great.
""I have been building towards it and qualifying felt really optimum.""
Rosberg anticipates an action-packed race on the new Baku street track.
He said: ""They have done a great job up to now with the track.

Parish constable Dennis Le Moignan said it was the first time there had not been enough candidates.
He blamed a ""lack of interest"" and little understanding of the role.
However, others believe criticism of the douzaine over the appointment of a town centre manager may be behind the lack of volunteers for the unpaid position.
Shane Langlois, chairman of the Douzaine Council, said: ""Obviously there's been a lot of controversy over the town centre manager, but that's just guesswork.""
He said another possible reason for a lack of interest from parishioners was because the parish system was confusing, although the picture around the rest of the island was more encouraging.
Mr Langlois said: ""There are far more contested elections than I've ever seen... it's very unusual and encouraging. There's normally not more than one or two.""
He has called for an end to electors' meetings where elections are uncontested - as currently parishioners can vote for ballots to take place - describing them as unnecessary.
Mr Le Moignan said the St Peter Port Douzaine would have to advertise the fifth position again and hold another election at a later date.

398,"Sir Philip had put a ""substantial"" recovery plan in place to resolve the deficit in pension schemes at Top Shop owner Arcadia, Mr Field said.
However, the original fix for the BHS scheme had been ""inadequate"", he said.
Sir Philip owned BHS for 15 years before selling it in March 2015.
It was bought for £1 by Dominic Chappell, a former bankrupt with little experience in retailing, and went into administration a year later.
There followed a lengthy and often rancorous investigation by the Work and Pensions Committee into the handling of the BHS pension fund.
Sir Philip promised to ""sort"" the problem and after months of negotiations with the Pensions Regulator, he agreed, in February, to pay £363m to bolster the BHS scheme.
The Work and Pensions Committee also sought information about the pension schemes of Arcadia, the owner of Dorothy Perkins and Miss Selfridge, and controlled by Sir Philip.
Over the weekend, documents published by the committee showed that Arcadia had a deficit in its pension schemes of almost £565m in March 2016.
That is up from almost £456m, when the previous assessment was made in March 2013.
To address that shortfall Arcadia has doubled its annual contribution to the two main funds to £50m.
""This is a credible plan for tackling a giant deficit and great news for Arcadia pensioners who must have been concerned,"" said Mr Field.
""It is though clear from these figures that Sir Philip was long favouring the Arcadia schemes over their BHS counterparts, which have more members,"" he said.
In 2012, while BHS was under the ownership of Sir Philip, a 23-year plan to fix the pension deficit was agreed.
Mr Field described that plan as ""ludicrous"" and contrasted it with a 13-year recovery plan for Arcadia pension schemes, which included much bigger contributions to cover the deficit.
""I imagine Sir Philip would say that Arcadia could afford it because it was profitable, whereas BHS was not,"" Mr Field said.

401,"Scientists believe kissing helps people judge the quality of a potential mate through taste, smell and fitness.
Once in a relationship, the Oxford University study found kissing was a way of getting a partner to stick around.
Women were found to value kissing more highly in long-term relationships.
An online survey of 900 adults by the Oxford team, published in the journal Archives of Sexual Behaviour, showed that men and women who were more attractive or had more casual sex partners were more selective in choosing mates, and those groups valued kissing more highly.
This suggests that kissing helps in sizing up a potential partner, the study says.
Professor Robin Dunbar, from the department of experimental psychology at Oxford University, said courtship in humans was complex and involved a whole series of assessments before men and women decided to carry on their relationship.
""Initial attraction may include facial, body and social cues. Then assessments become more and more intimate as we go deeper into the courtship stages, and this is where kissing comes in.
""In choosing partners, we have to deal with the 'Jane Austen problem': How long do you wait for Mr Darcy to come along when you can't wait forever and there may be lots of you waiting just for him? At what point do you have to compromise for the curate?""
Prof Dunbar said that Jane Austen, whose works of romantic fiction included Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility, realised that people were extremely good at assessing where they were in the ""mating market"" and pitching their demands accordingly.
""It depends what kind of poker hand you've been dealt.
""If you have a strong bidding hand, you can afford to be much more demanding and choosy when it comes to prospective mates,"" he said,
If kissing plays a part in selecting a partner then it also plays an important role before sex in short relationships and at a range of different times in committed relationships, the study found.
The study found that kissing was particularly important to women in long-term relationships.
This may be because it plays a role in increasing feelings of affection and attachment among couples, the researchers suggest.
Previous research had found that women placed greater value on activities that strengthen long-term relationships because being pregnant and raising children is easier when two parents are present.
In another study in Human Nature, researchers from Oxford suggest that women's attitude to romantic kissing also depends on where in their menstrual cycle and their relationship they are.
Women valued kissing most at the start of a relationship and around the time they were most likely to conceive in their cycle.","Kissing helps us assess potential partners if, like a Jane Austen heroine, we cannot wait forever for Mr Darcy to come along, a study suggests."

Entrants in the three-day event were judged on ""sustained volume"" from a 20m (65ft) distance, diction and bearing among other things.
Mr Wylie, who almost lost his voice in the effort, said: ""I decided to give it my all and my all is what it took.""
Having been Calne's town crier since 2007, Mr Wylie normally dons a heavy, ""made-to-fit"" uniform in the colours of the town's flag.
But to compete in the tropical heat, a special lightweight cotton outfit had to be made.
""My normal regalia is 100% wool and I would have melted in that,"" he said.
""So my wife made me a new set which was the right weight and very comfortable to wear.""
Held over three days with a different cry staged each day, Mr Wylie managed to oust the reigning world champion - Canadian Chris Whyman - by winning all three.
""My voice is better than it was but it's still rough,"" he said.
""Some criers seem to be able to bellow for as long as they like and it doesn't affect them at all.  I'm not too bad usually but in the final round, I could feel it was already pretty hoarse.""
Despite almost losing his voice in the final stages of the competition, the Wiltshire crier not only took the championship trophy but the winner's reward as well.

404,"The electrostatic coating allows the netting to carry much higher doses of insecticide.
In experiments, the coating killed off many more mosquitoes than usual.
Dutch researchers, writing in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, say this could help control diseases such as malaria.
Insecticide resistance in mosquitoes has become a significant problem in many parts of the world where malaria is endemic.
It is thought that water-based spray insecticides and bed nets, which often contain low levels of insecticide, don't always kill the mosquitoes, allowing them to develop resistance.
In this study, researchers from the Netherlands used a charged surface, originally developed for trapping airborne pollen, and applied insecticide to it.
The long-lasting electrostatic charge allowed high levels of insecticide to stick fast to the netting, giving the mosquitoes a lethal overdose when they came into contact with the surface - even for just a few seconds.
The technique was tested on different strains of mosquito in South Africa, Tanzania and at a lab at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine.
The research team found that the electrostatic coating of insecticide killed more mosquitoes than other nettings and, for certain insecticide-resistant mosquitoes, was 100% effective.
Conventional nettings kill fewer than 10% of mosquitoes, the study said.
Marit Farenhorst, who led the research, from In2Care at Wageningen University in the Netherlands, said the coating could be used on screens on windows and doors around the home, on curtains and walls, and in mosquito traps and wall ventilation tubes in homes.
""It's a new way of trying to target and contaminate mosquitoes,"" she said.
She also said the new method would be suitable for a number of different types of chemical insecticide.
However, she said the coating was probably not suitable for bed nets because people regularly touch and wash them so the insecticide would come off over time.","A new method of applying insecticide to netting has proved 100% effective against some strains of mosquito, an international study reports."
405,"It could see Spotify register shares on a stock exchange and become a publicly listed company without raising new cash, the Wall Street Journal reported.
Shares would be traded on the day of listing, with the price based on supply and demand, rather than new investors buying shares the day before trading.
Spotify declined to comment.
A direct listing would save the music service the underwriting fees needed to launch an initial public offering (IPO), and would avoid diluting the value of existing stakes in the company.
It could also sidestep a surge in first-day trading that often takes place after an IPO, which can signal that a company undervalued its newly issued shares.
The tactic, though rare, is usually used by smaller companies that do not expect high levels of trading in their stock.
A direct listing of a company is ""basically just sticking it on eBay"", says CMC Markets senior market analyst Michael Hewson.
Whereas with an IPO new investors can buy shares from existing investors the day before trading begins, with a direct listing investors buy shares on the open market on the day they are listed for the going rate.
Very rare. ""No-one does it,"" says Mr Hewson. Normally firms use an IPO as an opportunity to make lots of cash.
In general, IPOs can also cost a fair chunk of money, and, crucially for Spotify, they can take a lot of time to set up.
An IPO needs an investment bank or banks to underwrite an issue of new stock. Underwriting often amounts to the bank buying new stock to resell after the company floats.
The bank also looks at the company as part of the process for setting a reasonable initial offer price for the shares. The underwriters ""build a book"" - that is, they go to institutional investors to gauge the appetite for the shares in the company that's going to be floated. Fund managers say how many shares they want and the price they would be willing to pay, and the level of this demand is one of the factors used to set the initial offer price.
All of this to-ing and fro-ing eats up cash and time - and for Spotify, the clock is ticking.
In March last year, the firm raised $1bn from investors at an interest rate of 5% a year, plus a discount of 20% on shares once they list.
But under the terms of the agreement, the interest rate goes up by one percentage point and the discount by 2.5 percentage points every six months until the shares are listed.
So as time ticks by, Spotify has to pay more to its creditors, and give them more of a discount on shares.
As well as being a faster process, direct listing also means fewer regulatory hurdles, and it helps keeps expectations about share prices in check.
Spotify, which last year issued a $1bn (Â£801m) convertible bond, was publicly valued at $8.5bn (Â£6.8bn) in 2015.
The Swedish firm was founded more than a decade ago and now has more than 50 million paying subscribers.
This week it also signed a new long-term licensing deal with Universal Music Group, the world's largest record label.
Spotify includes TPG and Goldman Sachs among its major investors.",Spotify is reportedly considering an unconventional direct listing on a stock market that stops short of a full-blown initial public offering.
406,"Global Wireless Solutions polled 2,000 mobile-phone users and found 40% had blackspots at home, with most problems reported in Liverpool and Cardiff.
However telecoms analyst Matthew Howett says the situation is going to improve.
He told the BBC: ""This should get better as operators are using different frequencies to provide coverage.""
He added: ""I don't think the results of the survey are hugely surprising as it is the sort of common problem most of us have experience of - whether at home or increasingly in the office.
""But EE and Three offer something which lets you use your own existing broadband connection and equipment to make and receive calls and text messages although it might not currently work with every device.
""For a long time, Vodafone and others have offered a product called a 'signal booster' which is a piece of hardware you connect to your home broadband to make the above possible and that would support a wider range of devices.
""The advantage of the new solution from EE and Three is that you don't need that bit of kit.""
The survey revealed that the most likely blackspot in people's homes was in the kitchen and that Georgian houses or those built in the 2000s are the hardest in which to get a signal.
Sixty per cent of respondents in Liverpool reported having problems making and receiving calls on their mobiles at home with 54% of people in Cardiff and 53% in Bristol also suffering.
Paul Carter, chief executive officer of GWS, said: ""The UK is no longer a fixed-line nation. When we're at home, we don't just receive calls on our mobiles, we make them too. The best phone is the one you've got on you - not the one sitting in its dock out in the hallway.""
However, the frustrations could soon be at an end, according to Mr Howett.
O2 has committed to a regulatory requirement of providing indoor 4G coverage to 98% of the population by 2017 and he added: ""I would be surprised if this problem lasts beyond then.""","Nearly half of people living in Britain have problems making and receiving mobile calls at home, according to a survey by a network testing company."
407,"Academics from Edinburgh and Essex universities commissioned a survey of several thousand voters.
The results indicated that just 3.4% of ""No"" voters saw ""The Vow"" as the main motivation for their decision.
A spokesman for the SNP said polling immediately after the September vote produced a different result.
The new research by the Centre on Constitutional Change found the biggest factor identified by opponents of independence in making their decision was ""feeling British/believe in the Union"", cited by 29.5%.
Other factors highlighted included:
Factors identified by Yes voters in explaining their defeat included:
Report co-author Ailsa Henderson, of the University of Edinburgh, said: ""There is clearly a divergence between the perception among Yes voters that the offer of more powers was an important aspect of the campaign and reality of how No voters reached their decision.
""The issue of 'more powers' is not cited as the main reason for voting No.
""However, Yes voters are convinced it caused a loss of nerve leading to support for the Union.""
Her colleague Dr Rob Johns, of the University of Essex, added: ""The trajectory of opinion during the campaign suggests that the drift back to No predated the famous 'Vow' on the Daily Record's front cover.
""It is not unusual for a misleading narrative to develop about what swung an election or referendum. According to our data, anyone who thinks 'it was the Vow wot won it' is exaggerating, to say the least.
""However, once these narratives develop, they can be hard to shift. We may well see the effect of this one when voters turn out for the general election in May.""
YouGov questioned 4,849 people between 22 August and 17 September, 2014. They surveyed another 3,719 people from 22 to 26 September.
Scottish Conservative chief whip John Lamont said: ""All three pro-UK parties came up with plans for a more powerful Scottish Parliament before the referendum and, whoever is in power after the general election, those powers will be delivered to make Holyrood a more responsible and accountable parliament.
""Contrary to Alex Salmond's bluster, we have all been good to our word on delivering these powers.""
A Scottish Labour spokesman commented: ""While it is interesting to carry out these academic exercises, at the end of the day a substantial majority of the electorate voted to stay part of the UK.""
A spokesman for the SNP said: ""While we were disappointed with the result of the referendum, this study shows that a clear legacy has been greater political involvement, particularly amongst young people, and that is something to be proud of.
""Polling conducted immediately after the referendum showed that a quarter of No voters regarded the promise of extra powers as important in informing their decision - and nearly 10% of No voters only made up their mind in the last week.
""Undoubtedly, the Westminster parties published the Vow because all of their information indicated that it would have a big impact on the result.""","The promise of more powers for Holyrood made little difference to the outcome of the independence referendum, according to a new report."

Moldovan-born Sergiu Ciobanu clocked 2:15.14 with Raheny's Mick Clohisey just ahead of Pollock in 2:15.35.
Ireland will only be able to send three male marathon entrants to Rio so Pollock now faces the prospect of having to run quicker next spring if he wants to maintain his Rio dream.
Clonliffe athlete Ciobanu declared for Ireland during the summer and has been a regular on the distance running scene in his adopted country for several years.

409,"Minh To, of Stockport, Greater Manchester said he was left ""scared"" and ""terrified"" after seeing pictures of the five-bedroom home on Rightmove.
Police later discovered two men had stolen his mail and forged his signature in order to falsify the documents needed to auction the house.
Two men have been jailed for their part in the scam at Preston Crown Court.
Mike Haley, deputy chief executive of the fraud prevention organisation CIFAS, said Mr To had been ""more vulnerable"" to the fraud because he had paid off his mortgage.
Saeed Ghani and Atif Mahmood both admitted conspiracy to defraud.
Ghani, 30, of Polefield Circle, Prestwich, was jailed for seven and a half years.
Mahmood, 42, of Sarnsfield Close, Gorton, was sentenced to two years and nine months.
On Wednesday a third member of the gang, Toma Ramanauskaite, was sentenced for a separate fraud.
Mr To was first alerted to what was going on when he received a phone call from his daughter in November 2012.
He said: ""She rang me and said 'where are you going?' I said 'I'm going nowhere'. Then she said 'Why are you selling the house then? I've seen it on Rightmove'.
""I didn't know what to think. I felt terrible. I felt scared.""
Mr To logged on to the website to find the advert featured several pictures of his home and was inviting bids starting at £300,000.
The details even included a request that the tenants were ""not to be disturbed"".
Police later discovered Ghani and Mahmood carried out the fraud after stealing three utility bills from Mr To's mailbox.
Having forged his signature, they then transferred the deeds to his house into Ghani's name.
They put the property up for auction in the hope it would sell quickly, without the need for estate agents to show people around.
Mr To discovered the advert just three days before the auction was due to commence.
The court heard Ghani had carried out a similar fraud targeting a couple in Bolton, using fraudulent passports to transfer the deeds to their £300,000 house into his name.
Working with Ramanauskaite, he also took out driving licences in the names of a couple from Salford, before stealing their savings of £90,000.
Ramanauskaite, 30, of Spring Street, Bury, also admitted conspiracy to defraud and was sentenced to 14 months, suspended for two years, and ordered to carry out 250 hours in unpaid work.
Because Mr To had paid off his mortgage, the men were able to transfer the deeds without needing the extra authority of the lender.
He believes the rules need tightening before more people are targeted.
""It's very simple. The government should make it the law that if you're going to change the land registry deeds you should need two signatures,"" Mr To said.
Det Sgt Phil Larratt, of Greater Manchester Police, said: ""As this case demonstrates, fraudsters can use your identity details to open new bank accounts, request new driving licences and even try and steal your own home.
""We urge the public to secure their mail boxes and employ measures to protect their identities.""","An identity fraud victim has described the horror of discovering his £500,000 home up for sale on a property website."

But Swansea withstood the pressure and, following last Saturday's first league win at Manchester United, are level on points with top-of-the-table Chelsea.
Defeat for Burnley, meanwhile, leaves them still searching for a first Premier League point of the campaign, although their battling display will have been encouraging for manager Sean Dyche.
Swansea boss Garry Monk named an unchanged team from the opening-day triumph at Old Trafford, with new signings Federico Fernandez and Tom Carroll left out of the squad.
Burnley also stuck with the same side which lost 3-1 to Chelsea on Monday, although Stephen Ward was named on the bench after joining from Wolves.
The opening defeat by Chelsea was a chastening reintroduction to Premier League football for the Clarets, who were overwhelmed in midfield, and they were similarly outnumbered by Swansea.
The hosts stretched their opponents at every opportunity, with wingers Dyer and Wayne Routledge particularly threatening in the opening exchanges.
Routledge created early chances for Wilfried Bony and Gylfi Sigurdsson, but it was Dyer who opened the scoring.
Latching on to Sigurdsson's through ball, Dyer scampered into the penalty area and shot low into the net despite a touch from Burnley keeper Heaton.

Swansea were well worth their lead and, apart from a swerving 20-yard shot from Burnley striker Danny Ings, Monk's men were not troubled during a comfortable first half.
They faced a reinvigorated Burnley side after the restart, however, and the visitors were close to equalising when Jutkiewicz headed narrowly over after an hour.
Jones then had a shot palmed wide by Lukasz Fabianski, while Swansea brought on summer signings Bafetimbi Gomis and Jefferson Montero for Bony and Dyer as they sought to regain the initiative.
Although Gomis and Montero injected pace and urgency into the home attack, it was the Swansea defenders who were most influential in the closing moments.
With captain and centre-back Ashley Williams a steadying presence on his 30th birthday, the Swans repelled a flurry of late Burnley attacks to cling on to a second successive win and consign the Clarets to another defeat.
Swansea manager Garry Monk: ""It's a fantastic start and great to have six points.
""It's the best start we could have had, but we know we are only two games from being on your back and getting dragged down.

The results of the election are said to be expected later tonight.
The Gambia has a unique way of voting for the president.
Instead of using ballot papers, voters put a marble into a coloured drum for their candidate.
The system is aimed at tackling illiteracy and preventing rigging.
In the 2011 election, only two votes were declared invalid after people placed their marbles on top of drums.
Observers say Mr Barrow, who, according to British news reports, was once a security guard in the UK high street store Argos, has generated fresh enthusiasm among opposition supporters.
Human rights groups accuse Mr Jammeh, who has in the past claimed he can cure Aids and infertility, of repression and abuses.

414,"After talks with UN and Arab diplomats in Geneva, he said progress had been made on a plan to reduce violence in the second city of Aleppo.
However, he said more work was needed and there was no guarantee of success.
A cessation of hostilities has reduced fighting in Syria's five-year civil war but has unravelled in recent days.
About 250 people have reportedly been killed in Aleppo in the past nine days.
On Monday, fresh government air strikes and artillery attacks on rebel-held districts and suburbs of Aleppo left at least three dead, according to activists.
Mr Kerry, speaking alongside UN special envoy Staffan de Mistura after a morning of talks in Geneva, said the conflict was ""in many ways out of control and deeply disturbing"".
He said the nine-week-old cessation of hostilities had had ""a profoundly positive effect"" and saved many lives, but in recent weeks it had been ""put to the test"".
Mr Kerry said the goal was to reinforce a broad truce that could withstand further tests. He also promised more ceasefire monitors to track violations ""24 hours a day, seven days a week"".
""We're trying to press this as fast as possible but I don't want to make any promises that can't be kept,"" he said.
The US secretary of state said a recent air strike on a hospital in Aleppo, which he blamed on the Syrian government, was ""unconscionable"" but he added that both sides, the opposition and the regime, had contributed to ""this chaos"".
Before leaving Geneva, Mr Kerry spoke by telephone to his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov. Both men reiterated calls for all sides to observe the cessation of hostilities, the Russian foreign ministry said.
Mr de Mistura is due to travel to Russia on Tuesday.
Mr Kerry's trip to Geneva was hastily arranged after Mr de Mistura appealed to the US and Russia, which back opposing sides in Syria's five-year conflict, to rescue the cessation of hostilities they brokered in February.
At the start of a meeting with Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir on Monday, Mr Kerry said he would press rebel groups in Aleppo to separate themselves from the powerful jihadist group, al-Nusra Front.
""This is what we're discussing, among other things. There are a number of different ways to approach it,"" Mr Kerry told reporters.
""We're getting closer to a place of understanding. But we have some work to do.""
The Syrian government and Russia have said the Aleppo air strikes are targeting only al-Nusra, which is affiliated to al-Qaeda and is excluded from the cessation of hostilities along with the rival Islamic State group.
However, the opposition and the US have dismissed the claim, and accused the government of targeting civilians and rebels abiding by the cessation of hostilities.
""What is happening in Aleppo is an outrage. It's a violation of all humanitarian laws. It's a crime,"" Mr Jubeir said, adding that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad would be held accountable and would be removed from power either through a political process or by force.
The fighting in Aleppo has also seen dozens of civilians killed in rebel artillery attacks on government-held areas.
After at least 50 people were killed in a reported government air strike on a hospital last Wednesday night, the International Committee of the Red Cross warned that Aleppo was being ""pushed further to the brink of humanitarian disaster"".
Large parts of the city have been destroyed and its infrastructure has been severely damaged, leaving civilians without water and electricity for months.
The talks in Geneva come a day after the Syrian military extended a ""regime of calm"" around the capital, Damascus, for another 24 hours.

""If held under current rules and conditions, a referendum on the status of Darfur cannot be considered a credible expression of the will of the people of Darfur,"" said US State Department spokesman Mark Toner.
The referendum is the last step in a peace process negotiated in Doha. Rebels have long requested more regional powers to end what they see as Khartoum's interference in land ownership conflicts.
If Darfur chose to form one region, it would carry more weight within Sudan, they believe.
But the BBC's West Africa Correspondent Thomas Fessy, who recently visited Darfur with Mr Bashir, says many of those who initially wanted this referendum will be likely to boycott the vote because they say it will not be fair.

The International Criminal Court (ICC) has indicted President Bashir on counts of genocide and war crimes committed in Darfur.
Mr Bashir - who has told the BBC he will step down as president in 2020 - has dismissed the ICC as a ""political tribunal"".","The western Sudanese region of Darfur is to vote on its administrative status, 13 years after the start of a conflict which has left 300,000 dead."
416,"Defence coach Shaun Edwards and forwards coach Robin McBryde are out of contract at the end of the World Cup.
And attack coach Rob Howley's deal will expire after next summer's tour.
Given Gatland is under contract until the 2019 World Cup, Davies said he ""may well look to see if there's a need to renew the coaching set-up"".
Head coach Gatland and his assistants have worked together since 2008, winning three Six Nations titles, including two Grand Slams, and fly-half Dan Biggar has said it is vital they remain in place.
Having reached the World Cup semi-final in 2011, they were knocked out at the quarter-final stage this time by a 23-19 loss to South Africa.
Davies said he and Gatland will now evaluate the performances, which included a win over England in the pool stage, and discuss what happens next.
""We'll have a conversation to see how everything went in the competition,"" Davies said.
""It's not just when you fail to get out of the group that needs to be done, like all the focus has been on England.
""There needs to be a review on how we can improve moving forward.""

The Rugby Football Union has begun its inquest into England's disappointing World Cup campaign, which ended at the pool stage following defeats to Wales and Australia at Twickenham.
If the report's conclusion is to sack head coach Stuart Lancaster, reports suggest England may attempt to tempt Gatland away from Wales.
Edwards, who has moulded Wales into one of the world's best defensive outfits, could also be courted by England, especially given his immediate availability.
Gatland's worth to Wales was highlighted in December 2013 when he was given a contract extension until 2019 and Davies fully expects him to see it through.
""I think he's done some really good work to be perfectly honest,"" Davies added.
""If you look at all the difficulties we've had in this competition... the fact is that we've performed better than the expectation, when you consider all the injuries we've had.
""So as I said, Warren has a contract that lasts another four years so it's up to him to assess who he wants for Wales.
""I'm not really interested in all this talk in the papers of who wants him, because that fact is he's under contract with the Welsh Rugby Union.""","Warren Gatland will be the one to decide whether changes are needed to his coaching team, according to Welsh Rugby Union chairman Gareth Davies."

""The way Swansea won it was great. Football is full of these surprises.

The former Liverpool striker said the Swans deserved their victory, however, and claimed it was not only down to a poor Liverpool performance.
""In the first half, Swansea were very well focussed and organised. Liverpool probably thought the game was going to be a lot easier than it turned out to be.
""Swansea, to go away from home and score three goals at Anfield or anywhere in the Premier League is a terrific achievement.

A product of Spurs' academy, he made his first-team debut in 2014 after loan spells at Peterborough and Swindon.
Pritchard, who spent last season on loan at Brentford, where he scored 12 goals in 47 games, has played just once for Spurs this season.
The England Under-21 international signed a new four-year deal with Tottenham last summer.
""It's been a hectic few hours - I was close to going elsewhere,"" he said. ""But when this came about I didn't hesitate to come here.""
""West Bromwich Albion indicated that they had no intention of changing their stance on selling Saido Berahino in advance of deadline day, and were true to their word, despite endless hyping of the possibility from outside.

419,"The Dutchman was teed up on the edge of the area by the excellent Dusan Tadic and connected with the outside of his boot to drive his shot into the top corner as Saints took the lead on 25 minutes.
The Baggies pressed for an equaliser but failed to score for the fifth time in their last six games.
They were continually thwarted by England goalkeeper Fraser Forster who made three stunning saves.
The first saw him claw away a Salomon Rondon header in the first half and he then denied Craig Dawson and Jonny Evans deep into injury time as Saints held on for the win.
Tony Pulis' side have now lost four of their last six and are stuttering in their attempts to achieve their best league finish since 1981, when they came fourth.
The win leaves ninth-placed Southampton just four points behind the Baggies, who stay eighth.
Scotland winger Matt Phillips made his first start since February, but he could not inspire West Brom.
Last season they failed to win any of their last nine league games, with five defeats and four draws.
They are three games into their final nine matches of this campaign and their record reads two defeats and one draw.
While goals are clearly a problem at the moment, the Albion defence is also struggling with just three clean sheets in their last 20 league games.
Albion were not short on chances with 17 shots in the game, six of which were on target. They had 18 attempts in the 2-0 midweek defeat by Watford and Pulis is disappointed his side are not taking their chances.
""We have had 35 shots over the last two games, we need to have more composure and steadiness in front of goal,"" Pulis told BBC Sport.
Still, barring a dramatic collapse, they should be able to achieve the Chinese owners' target of a top-10 finish this season.
Performances like today will put Forster back in contention to challenge Joe Hart for the England jersey.
The 29-year-old made six saves today and manager Claude Puel paid tribute. saying: ""Fraser was the difference at the end, he preserved the three points.""
It was his two injury-time saves that really caught the eye.
In the 93rd minute Jake Livermore played the ball over the top and Dawson managed to connect with a volley that Forster saved at point-blank range.
Two minutes later, Chris Brunt's corner was flicked on by Livermore and Evans' side-footed shot was slapped away by the former Newcastle keeper.
Before those heroics it had been Tadic who had starred for Saints. Since making his Premier League debut in August 2014, following his £10.9m move from FC Twente, he has provided 24 assists.
Only Chelsea's Cesc Fabregas (32), Arsenal's Mesut Ozil (30) and Tottenham's Christian Eriksen (26) have more.
Southampton have now lost just one of their last six league games, after losing six and winning just one of the seven before that.

Puel told BBC Sport: ""It was an excellent performance. We played a good first-half and could have scored another goal. It was a perfect second half, you can see the character of the players and the team.
""To get a clean sheet here is good with the quality of West Brom and the quality of their set-pieces. After the win against Crystal Palace, it's another good performance in terms of consistency.

Pulis told BBC Sport: ""We created better opportunities in the second half and as the game went on we controlled the last 25 minutes and I felt we did enough to get something out of the game.
""It is disappointing considering the chances were there, especially in the second half. We have had 35 shots over the last two games. We need to have more composure and steadiness in front of goal.

420,"Joan Edwards passed away in September 2012, aged 90, and left her estate to ""whichever government is in office at the date of my death for the government in their absolute discretion to use as they may think fit"".
This wording however caused some confusion.
The executors of the will interpreted this to be a donation to the political party in power, and both the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats accepted the donation.
The public outcry that followed caused both parties quickly to hand back the money so that it could go to the Treasury.
Miss Edwards had been a nurse, so it was argued by many, that her intention must have been for it to go to the NHS.
It may never be clear what her true intention was - but what is clear is that the wording used in the will was ambiguous.
The second case that has hit the headlines involves an anonymous £500,000 legacy made also to the government in 1928, which came with the strict stipulation that it ""could only be used to reduce the national debt to zero"".
Eighty-five years later and the fund is estimated to be worth £350m, but because the national debt stands at about £1.2 trillion, it cannot be touched.
It would in this instance have been helpful for the will to have contained a clause that covered this scenario, or if the wording was a little more clear.
When the courts have to rule in cases interpreting a will, there is the ""armchair principle"" in England and Wales.
The court will endeavour to discover the intention of the deceased (the ""testator"") and by looking at extra evidence submitted.
It would therefore place itself in the ""armchair"" of the testator and consider the circumstances that surrounded them when they made their will, to assist arriving at their intention.
The law in Scotland and Northern Ireland may differ and separate legal advice should be sought.
Homemade wills need to be very carefully drafted.
It can be a false economy to make a homemade will, if your beneficiaries then face a costly legal battle to prove your intentions in court.
Strict rules governing the way a will is made and executed mean that errors can be made very easily which can invalidate it.
These errors often include not signing the will or having it witnessed correctly.
Source: Susan Midha
The wording of a will can also be problematic as words and terms have specific meanings in law, which may be different to their use by the testator in their will.
There are regularly problems with the naming and the identification of individuals in wills.
Referring to people by nickname, or an abbreviated name, may cause confusion.
Also be careful if you have family members of the same name.
If you are related to two John Smiths but only want one to be a beneficiary, then make sure you specify which one is the true beneficiary.
Don't forget to include substitute beneficiaries if someone you name as a beneficiary dies before you - and don't assume that the children of a deceased beneficiary will (or will not) take their parents' share - there are special rules which can apply.
Altering your will by crossing out sections or making amendments after it has been signed will usually mean the alterations will be invalid and can lead to conflict within the family which can end up in the courts.
And it is worth remembering that your will when proved after your death becomes a matter of public record - which means that any one can look at it and obtain a copy.
So references to, for example, ""that waste of space who is my son"" may be worth avoiding.
If your will is judged to be invalid then your estate would be distributed in accordance with an earlier valid will or by the intestacy laws.
Your intention may not be for the government to benefit, but if there are no family members to inherit and no will, your estate will usually pass to the Crown, ultimately funding the Queen's activities as head of state.

He added that if he acted decisively it would be good for him and for the party.

429,"Mrs May said the convention, which is separate from the EU, ""can bind the hands of Parliament"".
David Cameron has previously refused to rule out leaving the convention.
Ex-cabinet minister and Leave campaigner Iain Duncan Smith said her ""remarkable intervention"" had ""utterly undermined"" the government's position.
In her first major speech of the referendum campaign, Mrs May said the UK had to ""stand tall and lead in Europe"" rather than leaving the EU, and that membership made the UK  ""more secure from crime and terrorism"".
She also raised concerns about more countries joining the EU.
The ECHR, which is separate from the EU institutions, was incorporated into UK law by the Human Rights Act.
The Conservatives have pledged to replace the Human Rights Act with a ""British Bill of Rights"" but have not proposed leaving the convention altogether.
BBC political editor
The home secretary is one of the most senior politicians in the country. Of course, her backing of the Remain campaign is important. And it's certainly better for the prime minister and the Remain campaign to have her In, rather than Out.
But her qualified support suggests there are three, rather than two, positions at the top of the Conservative party - 'Remain', 'Leave', and perhaps now, 'Reluctant Remain'.
It was the Out campaign struggling to contain their internal differences. Tonight, it feels like cracks might appear on the other side too.

A Downing Street spokeswoman urged journalists not to ""overdo the differences"" between the prime minister and the home secretary on withdrawal from the ECHR.
She said Mr Cameron ""rules nothing out"" as he seeks reform of the convention, saying the home secretary had been ""setting out a clear distinction between the ECHR and the EU"".
Regardless of the outcome of the 23 June EU referendum, Mrs May said she still believed the UK should leave the ECHR which she said ""adds nothing to our prosperity"".
It was the ECHR, not the EU, that was responsible for controversial human rights decision affecting the UK, she said.
Earlier pro-Leave Justice Secretary Michael Gove  warned that five potential new members of the EU - Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, Albania and Turkey - would result in millions more people having the right to move to the UK.
Mrs May said Albania, Serbia and Turkey had ""poor populations and serious problems with organised crime, corruption, and sometimes even terrorism"".
She added: ""We have to ask ourselves, is it really right that the EU should just continue to expand, conferring upon all new member states all the rights of membership?""
She said the UK had ""forgotten how to lead"" in Europe and must re-assert itself to force change from within, adding that it could veto Turkey joining the EU.
In her speech - and during a question and answer session - Mrs May admitted that being in the EU made it harder to control the ""volume of immigration"". But she said the UK was able to control its border by blocking entry to terrorists.
She praised David Cameron's leadership in trying to seek a better deal for the UK, but said the UK's collective posture was too often to ""blame Europe"" for its problems and the UK ""has to have more confidence to get things done"" rather than ""shouting from the sidelines"".
Mrs May said the issue the British public faced on 23 June was how the UK ""maximised"" its ""prosperity, security, influence and sovereignty"".
In what she said was an analysis of ""the risks and opportunities"" of EU membership rather than an attack on Leave campaigners, she said the post-war order had seen the UK and other countries ""cede sovereignty in a controlled way"" by co-operating to prevent a greater loss of sovereignty through military conflict or economic decline.
Mrs May said the question was not whether the UK could ""survive"" outside the EU given that it was the world's fifth largest economy which had ""friendships and alliances across the world"" - but whether the UK was ""better off in or out"".
While ""the sky would not fall"" in the event of Brexit, she said she had concluded it was a matter of ""hard-headed national interest"" to remain in, based on security, trade and prosperity.
On security, she said EU membership enabled the UK to access EU-wide information, such as criminal records, to allow the UK to turn away serious criminals and terrorists at the border, fast-track the extradition of offenders and simplify the deportation of prisoners.
The UK had extensive intelligence-sharing with the US and other allies outside the EU, she said but being excluded from the EU-wide information sharing would make the UK ""less safe"".
However, she called for major changes to the way the UK did business in the EU, including reducing the power of the European Parliament and the European Court of Justice.
Mr Duncan Smith told the BBC the home secretary's comments on the ECHR and EU expansion had ""thrown the gauntlet down"" to the government.
On EU expansion, he claimed, the prime minister is ""in favour of extending our borders to Syria"" by allowing Turkey to join the EU.
""She actually basically questions the very campaign she says that she supports,"" he said.
""This is a remarkable intervention. She has really thrown the gauntlet down and undermines the whole of the 'vote stay in' campaign.""
Mr Duncan Smith said immigration was ""out of control"" and free movement of people rules meant the UK had to accept criminals coming into the country.
""An elected government in the UK elected on a platform to reduce immigration right now cannot deliver that because the EU is an open border,"" he told Radio 4's Today.
""You cannot reject anyone unless you can demonstrate categorically that they pose an immediate threat to the life and livelihood of the UK.""",Home Secretary Theresa May has said the UK should quit the European Convention on Human Rights while remaining in the European Union.

433,"Vauxhall's pension scheme is one of the largest in the UK, with 15,000 members.
Pensions expert John Ralfe said Peugeot owner PSA would not want to touch it ""with a barge pole"", saying he thought it had a deficit of about £1bn.
Half of the members were pensioners, Mr Ralfe told the BBC's Today programme.
The proposed sale will be discussed in the Commons on Monday afternoon after the Speaker granted an urgent question on the matter to the Labour MP for Ellesmere Port and Neston, Justin Madders.
Meanwhile a Downing Street spokesman confirmed that Prime Minister Theresa May was planning to meet Carlos Tavares, PSA chief executive, but a time and date for the meeting had not yet been fixed.
According to company filings to the end of 2014 - the latest available - the Vauxhall pension scheme had assets of about £1.8bn but liabilities of about £2.6bn, leaving a deficit of £840m.
Since then record low interest rates have hit the returns on government debt in which big pension schemes invest heavily, so the deficit had probably grown, Mr Ralfe said.
Last week it emerged that PSA Group, which also makes Citroen cars, was in talks about taking over GM's loss-making European business, Opel.
Mr Ralfe told Today the size of the deficit was a ""major issue for the takeover"". ""At best it's a stumbling block, at worst it could be a deal breaker,"" he said.
He said he was clear that PSA would not want to take on the pension scheme so they would only buy the operating assets, including the plant and the Vauxhall brand, leaving the pensions with General Motors UK.
""The trouble with that is that would then be a company with no assets, so what would have to happen ... is that General Motors US would have to issue a guarantee for that UK company,"" Mr Ralfe said.
PSA, which already works with GM in Europe on several projects, said a takeover was among ""numerous strategic initiatives"" being considered.
Any deal would involve Opel's UK arm, Vauxhall, which employs 4,500 staff at plants at Ellesmere Port and Luton.
Unite union leader Len McCluskey is also due to meet Mr Tavares this week to discuss the deal and any impact it might have on jobs.
Mr Ralfe said he did not think the Vauxhall pensioners needed to be worried about their position, but said that while politicians were ""running around all over the place asking about jobs, they should also be running around asking about pensions"".","Plans to sell the European arm of General Motors - including Vauxhall - to France's PSA Group could be derailed by the deficit in GM's UK pension scheme, an expert says."
434,"The government accepted recommendations by the Senior Salaries Review Body, saying pay restraint was one of the ""difficult choices"" it faced.
The award comes amid a row over the 1% cap on public sector rises.
After the general election, some ministers suggested a rethink, putting pressure on Chancellor Philip Hammond.
The government says its policy has not changed, and last week teachers were told they faced another year of 1% rises.
Most public sector pay is set by ministers after receiving recommendations from different pay review bodies.
These bodies have to take into account government policy, which since 2013 has been for a 1% increase across the public sector, although in theory they are able to recommend higher increases.
The Senior Salaries Review Board covers the senior civil service, senior military officers, the judiciary and senior managers working for arm's length bodies of the Department of Health.
For each group, the board recommended a 1% rise, which has been accepted by ministers.
In a written statement, Cabinet Office Minister Damian Green said the government ""greatly values"" public servants' work and understands the need to recruit, retain and motivate staff.
He added: ""However, there is a trade-off between pay and jobs in many public services, and pay restraint is one of the many difficult choices the government has had to make to help put the UK's public finances back on track.
""Senior public sector workers, like everyone else, will have to continue to play their part to ensure we deliver job security for working people across the country.""
Naomi Cooke, of senior civil servants' union the FDA, welcomed a government promise of a review of senior salaries, but added: ""What should be abundantly clear is that this cannot be achieved within a 1% straitjacket.
""Reform of senior civil service pay needs to be fully funded and it needs to happen soon - the current government pay policy is failing and is doing so in a way that costs civil servants and costs the public dear.""","Senior civil servants, military officers and judges are to receive 1% pay rises this year, ministers have announced."

More updates on BBC Live: Sussex
Industrial action by the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT) and high levels of staff sickness have hit services, with the introduction of a temporary emergency timetable initially cutting up to 341 trains a day.
Mr Maynard told the Commons: ""Some routes are still suffering badly and my priority is making sure services are being restored in a timely, sensible and lasting manner.""
""The real solution here is for the RMT to bring this dispute to a close and start to put passengers first,"" he added.
Mr Maynard also denied plans for ""more generous"" compensation to Southern Rail commuters affected by strikes were on the ""backburner"".
He also agreed to consider calls for season ticket holders to receive a rebate of up to 20%.
Meanwhile, Southern announced it would reinstate the full timetable from Tonbridge and Reigate to Redhill and London Victoria/London Bridge on Monday.
Alex Foulds, Southern's passenger services director, apologised to customers ""who have suffered ever since the RMT began their unnecessary action"".
He said the temporary weekday timetable had been delivering a ""more consistent, reliable"" service.
""We are steadily reintroducing trains and will continue to do so until the entire timetable is back in place,"" he added.
Mick Cash, RMT general secretary, called the changes ""pitiful"".
He added: ""The fact passengers are still paying through the nose for a vastly reduced service is solely due to the gross managerial incompetence and profiteering of this basket-case rail operator.
""Yet again Southern are blaming their staff for their own systemic failures...""
RMT spokesman Garry Hassell has said the dispute ""could last until Christmas"".",Rail Minister Paul Maynard has assured passengers he is determined to resolve issues on the troubled Southern network as a matter of urgency.

If the offence is racially or religiously aggravated, the current seven-year maximum will go up to 14.
Labour said ministers had ""changed their mind"" under pressure, having previously opposed tougher penalties.
In 2015, 194 people were convicted of stalking in England and Wales and were, on average, sentenced to 14 months in jail.
The government is expected to bring in the changes in an amendment to the Policing and Crime Bill, when it is debated in the Commons on Tuesday. The bill, which is in its final stages in Parliament, is likely to become law in the coming weeks.
It will also raise the maximum sentence for harassment from five to 10 years, and similarly from seven to 14 if it is racially or religiously aggravated.

""Every time you had a letter, it would get sent off for fingerprints. They'd find no fingerprints, so it would be logged and it would just carry on and on and on.""

Mr Gyimah said the sentences were being doubled so these ""awful crimes can be properly punished"".
But Labour said its amendment to the bill in the House of Lords in December, which would have doubled maximum sentences for the most serious offences, had been opposed by the government.
The amendment was approved by the Lords by 160 votes to 149 but 139 Conservative peers voted against.
However two Conservative MPs, Alex Chalk and Richard Graham, had campaigned to increase punishment for stalking. Mr Chalk introduced a private member's bill last year calling for the maximum sentence to be doubled.
Labour says there was a chance of a ""sizeable rebellion"" among Conservative MPs if the government sought to overturn the move when MPs debate it.
""Thankfully, under pressure, the Tories have changed their mind,"" said shadow justice secretary Richard Burgon.
""But more still needs to be done to ensure that victims of stalking feel confident enough that their complaint will be investigated properly when they first report it.""
Last month, new stalking protection orders were introduced to protect victims - especially those targeted by strangers or colleagues - at the very earliest possible stage.
Police in England and Wales can now apply to the courts for an order before a stalking suspect has been convicted or even arrested.
A typical order might ban the suspect from going near the victim or contacting them online, and could also make them undergo treatment if they have a mental health problem.
The orders follow legislation introduced in 2012 which made stalking a specific criminal offence in England and Wales.
In Scotland, stalking is illegal under the Criminal Justice and Licensing (Scotland) Act 2010 and in Northern Ireland it is prohibited under the Protection from Harassment Order (NI) 1997.",The maximum sentence for stalking available to courts in England and Wales is to rise from five years to 10.

But he told BBC News it would be ""not surprising"" if they had serious doubts about the direction Labour was taking under Jeremy Corbyn's leadership.
Mr Farron said he was contacted via text messages after Mr Corbyn was elected Labour leader on Saturday.
He said he had also spoken on the telephone to Labour MPs, but he declined to name names or say whether they were front bench figures.
Speaking to the Evening Standard, he said: ""I've had various unsolicited texts, some of them over the weekend, where I felt like I was being an agony aunt rather than anything else.
""People who have been members of the [Labour] party for as long as I've been a member of mine who feel that they don't recognise their party anymore and feel deeply distressed.""
Mr Farron, who was elected Lib Dem leader in July, was speaking ahead of the party's annual conference in Bournemouth, which gets under way at the weekend.
It is the party's first gathering since its crushing defeat at May's general election, when it lost all but eight of its MPs.
Mr Farron has called the election of Mr Corbyn a ""quite staggering opportunity"" for his party to occupy the centre ground in British politics, which he believes is being rapidly vacated by the New Labour leader in favour of a hard left agenda.
Quizzed about his contacts with Labour MPs on the BBC's Look North, he said: ""I am keen to be a decent sort and not betray any confidences - but it would be not surprising if Labour MPs, voters, members and indeed donors were thinking hang about this isn't the Labour Party that I voted for, I need a party that will hold the Tories to account, that can beat the Tories and which believes not just in social justice and fairness, but also in sound economics.

He played most of the 27-23 win over Scotland, but had his foot strapped after being replaced in the 76th minute.
""He (Biggar) is tough, so let's just hope he keeps going and doing what he has been doing,"" Jenkins told BBC Radio Wales.
""We need him to keep playing as well as he has. If sides target him, that is a positive for us, because it shows how well he has been playing.
""We can't hide him. Wherever he plays, unless we get him a seat near the posts, he will be targeted, (as) he was against Ireland and Scotland.
""If they want to target him, he is good enough and strong enough to deal with that and he should take it as a compliment.""
Jenkins also says Biggar's Ospreys half-back partner Rhys Webb needs more game-time before he is considered for a Wales recall.
Webb made his Ospreys comeback against Munster last Sunday after being out since September with a foot injury.

Defeat saw four-time winners Arsenal fail to reach the final for the first time in the cup's six-year history.
City will play at their own Academy Stadium in the final against Birmingham City on Sunday, 2 October, after their 4-0 win at London Bees on Saturday.
After City keeper Marie Hourihan had denied Asisat Oshoala on multiple occasions, the ball deflected straight to Beattie in the Arsenal six-yard box from a Toni Duggan free-kick with 11 minutes remaining and she fired in to win the game.
The winner came moments after Danielle Carter's powerful effort for the Gunners had struck the crossbar, and England captain Steph Houghton cleared the ball off the line late on to deny Arsenal again.
The first half had seen City go close to opening the scoring, with a Jane Ross shot deflected wide, before Arsenal forward Danielle van de Donk had to be withdrawn because of a concerning head injury, caused by a clash of heads.

""This was a calculated attempt to run him over and use your car as a weapon,"" the judge said.
""It would have been obvious that to do so would have carried significant risk of injury.""
The court heard how the pair nearly collided on Stoke Newington High Street on 10 February 2016, when Henshaw-Bryan pulled out in front of the cycle courier while using her mobile.
Mr Doughty confronted the driver over her use of the phone, at which point she shouted at him, the court heard.
Angered by the exchange, he kicked her wing mirror when they met at the next set of lights.
He was then chased down Victorian Grove and hit by Henshaw-Bryan's car.
