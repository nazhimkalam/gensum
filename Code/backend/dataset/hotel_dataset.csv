"The 32-year-old midfielder had trained alone or with the club's under-23s since Jose Mourinho was appointed United boss in the summer.
Former Germany captain Schweinsteiger last played for the Red Devils in March, when Louis van Gaal was manager.
He said in August he had ""no personal problems"" with Mourinho, and United will be his last club in Europe.
""It's great to see him back,"" said United left-back Luke Shaw. ""We found out the news a couple of days ago.
""He's a big influence in the dressing room and obviously on the pitch, especially for the young players like myself.""
It is unclear whether Mourinho will now consider Schweinsteiger for first-team action.
He was named in United's Premier League squad for this season, but left out of their Europa League squad.
Schweinsteiger has made 31 appearances for the club since his £14.4m move from Bayern Munich in July 2015.
Simon Stone, BBC Sport
Before Schweinsteiger can think about a return he still hoped for during the dark days of being forced to train on his own, he needs to know why Mourinho brought him back into the fold.
After all, he cannot play against Fenerbahce on Thursday because he is not in Mourinho's Europa League squad.
With Ander Herrera banned, Schweinsteiger is an option for United's Premier League trip to Swansea.
However, given he is so short of match practice, is that really an option? Or is Mourinho merely reminding potential January suitors that the 32-year-old still exists?",World Cup winner Bastian Schweinsteiger has returned to training with Manchester United's first team.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Radovan Krejcir was arrested on Friday at his home in Johannesburg on a charge of kidnap and assault.
His lawyers filed a court application, saying he needed medical attention and risked kidney failure.
Krejcir has repeatedly denied having links to the criminal underworld.
The police have been accused of reacting slowly to reports of his alleged involvement in the killing of underworld bosses, reports the BBC's Pumza Fihlani from Johannesburg.
A number of his associates have been killed in separate incidents in recent months, local media report.
In July, Krejcir survived an attempt to kill him carried out by guns hidden behind a car number plate operated by remote control opened fire on him in Bedfordview, a suburb east of Johannesburg.
Krejcir reportedly described the shooting as ""something out of a James Bond film"".
He is challenging the government's attempts to extradite him to the Czech Republic, where he was convicted in absentia last year on tax fraud charges.
He moved to South Africa in 2007.
Our correspondent says South Africans have been keenly watching Krejcir's extraordinary career over recent months and the series of gangland shootings and killings with which he is allegedly linked.
They are worried that it might show that a well-connected, sophisticated and violent underworld still exists on the streets of Johannesburg, she says.
On Saturday, police chief Riah Phiyega said Krejcir's arrest was a major breakthrough.
""There are many investigations that are taking place, even on the charges that the suspects have been arrested for. We hope to arrest more suspects as the investigations unfold,"" she told reporters in the capital, Pretoria.
She did not reveal details of the charges against him.
The police watchdog, the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid), said it had launched an investigation into Krejcir's claim that he had he had been tortured.
Police are accused of taking him to an open field where he was ""allegedly shocked with a taser and a plastic bag was placed over his head to suffocate him"", Ipid said in a statement.
The High Court in Johannesburg ordered that Krejcir be transferred to hospital after his doctor testified that his injuries were consistent with those of someone who had been assaulted.
He could face renal failure if he was not taken to hospital, the doctor said.
In his ruling, Judge Ramarumo Monama said the doctor was a credible witness.

"The 34-year-old, who was born in Brazil but plays for Portugal, has been linked with Paris St-Germain and AC Milan and has ""had proposals from England"".
Pepe has made 334 appearances for Real, winning three La Liga titles and three Champions League trophies.
He missed Saturday's win over Juventus and added: ""I didn't say goodbye because they knew before I did.""
Pepe announced his departure in an interview with radio station COPE, and said he had not spoken to manager Zinedine Zidane since Madrid's Champions League final win in Cardiff.
""What he has done for Real Madrid is spectacular, but there are things I still do not understand,"" Pepe said.
The centre-back, who was injured for part of the season with a hamstring problem and then broke two ribs in April, fell behind both Raphael Varane and Nacho in the challenge to play alongside captain Sergio Ramos in the Madrid defence.
""I've had years of great pride in which I have given my body and soul,"" he said. ""But I took the decision in January when it was clear which way it was going.
""I'm happy for the love of the people, and that's worth more than everything.""","Defender Pepe is leaving Real Madrid after 10 years at the Spanish club, having decided in January to move on.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The unnamed woman had agreed Greater Manchester Police (GMP) could refer to her experience in a training session providing she remained anonymous.
However, she later learned her identity and medical history were disclosed to a wider audience.
GMP has apologised and said ""steps"" had been taken to stop similar occurrences.
The victim's solicitor said the payout was believed to be one of the biggest by a British force in a privacy case.
In a witness statement, the woman, who agreed to an out-of-court settlement, said she ""felt betrayed by GMP"".
The errors in this case by Greater Manchester Police almost beggar belief. Safeguarding victims is the most important priority in domestic violence police work.
Revealing a victim's identity, medical history and distressed 999 call, against their wishes, represents very grave mistakes. This episode is hardly likely to increase victims' confidence in the police.
The case also illustrates the use of part of the civil law that has principally been seen in cases involving celebrities whose privacy has been breached by newspapers.
'Misuse of private information' has been argued in a number of cases. It relies on a breach of Article 8 of the 1988 Human Rights Act; the right to respect for a private and family life.
The claimant has to establish they have a reasonable expectation of privacy in relation to the information concerned, and that privacy has been breached.
The media can argue the claimant's right to privacy is outweighed by the right to freedom of expression and that there is a public interest in publishing. The police have no such defence.
This case shows that Article 8 is not simply for celebrities and that public bodies, such as the police, can be sued if they breach it.
Nick McAleenan, from JMW Solicitors, described his client as a ""successful, professional woman"".
He said she ""suffered psychiatric harm"" after learning that her personal information was disclosed and that a tape of her 999 call following an assault was played at a training session.
He added that GMP had initially refused to accept it had done anything wrong and its internal investigation concluded that no officer had infringed the police code of conduct.
In May 2014, the force admitted breaching the woman's privacy but refused to acknowledge she had suffered distress or loss as a result which would entitle her to any damages.
Mr McAleenan said: ""This is information out there in the public domain. She can't put the genie back in the bottle and it's something that she is going to have to live with for the rest of her life"".
A GMP spokeswoman said it was ""an exceptional case"", adding: ""The force has taken action to protect the individual's information to prevent any issue in the future.""
She added: ""We have apologised to the woman involved... This was an unacceptable mistake; however, it was done with the best of intentions as part of training for partner agencies around recognising the signs of domestic abuse.""
A spokesperson from the domestic abuse charity, Women's Aid, said: ""Survivors of domestic abuse should be able to expect the highest standards from the police - and the police should be extremely careful when dealing with survivors.
""The survivor in question could have been put in a very dangerous situation; highly manipulative perpetrators of domestic abuse will stop at nothing to find out where their former partner is, or to gather information on them.""","A domestic abuse victim has received £75,000 from a police force after it revealed details of her treatment by a former boyfriend without her consent.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The Liverpudlian is second on 3,932 points, 40 behind leader and reigning champion Brianne Theisen-Eaton.
Johnson-Thompson has said her main aim this weekend is to get the 6,200 points needed for Rio.
She needs 2,268 points on Sunday in the three remaining events.
The 23-year-old began the day equalling her personal best of 13.37 seconds in the 100m hurdles and followed it up by clearing 1.92m in the high jump, a personal best outdoors.
After two events, Johnson-Thompson was in the overall lead but slipped to sixth following a disappointing 11.55m in the shot put - the worst mark in the field and 1.59m below the personal best she set earlier in the season.
She made amends for that poor display with a personal best 22.79 secs in the 200m, which pulled her closer to Canada's world silver medallist Theisen-Eaton.
Johnson-Thompson will start with the long jump on Sunday, the event which ruined her chances of gold at last year's World Championships following her failure to record a legal jump.
She said: ""I'm sure I'll be nervous again in the long jump. I really want to get a good jump in the first round.
""This is my first big competition especially after a knee operation last autumn so I just want 6,200 points and to be injury free and to be going home with my ticket for the Olympics.""
The Briton has also said her experience in Beijing changed her, created a ""new Kat"" who is determined to bounce back and quash her demons.
Her performances on the opening day in Austria promised much not only for this competition but the summer ahead.
Although she has repeatedly said Olympic qualification rather than regaining the title she won in 2014 is her priority this weekend, she looks set to vie with favourite Theisen-Eaton for first place.
And despite a poor display in the shot, her weakest event, Johnson-Thompson will take heart that she achieved her best heptathlon score of 6682 points in Gotzis two years ago, when her total after the opening day was also 3923.
The long jump, javelin and 800m remain on Sunday but fellow Brit Morgan Lake - adrift of her personal bests in all four events on the first day - is likely to fall short of the total needed for Rio.
Lake - recording 14.43 secs in the 100m hurdles, 1.86m in the high jump, 13.18m in the shot put and 26.12 secs in the 200m - is 29th overall.

"A ceremony, attended by PM Shinzo Abe, was held at Hiroshima's memorial park before thousands of lanterns are released on the city's Motoyasu river.
The bombing - and a second one on Nagasaki three days later - is credited with bringing to an end World War Two.
But it claimed the lives of at least 140,000 people in the city.
A US B-29 bomber called the Enola Gay dropped the uranium bomb, exploding some 600m (1,800ft) above the city, at around 08:10 on 6 August 1945.
On that day alone, at least 70,000 people are believed to have been killed. Many more died of horrific injuries caused by radiation poisoning in the days, weeks and months that followed.
People across Japan have observed a minute's silence to mark the anniversary. In Hiroshima a bell tolled at 08:15 local time - when the US aircraft dropped the bomb that flattened the city centre.
Addressing 40,000 people who attended the commemoration ceremony at Hiroshima's peace park near the epicentre of the 1945 attack, Mr Abe called for worldwide nuclear disarmament.
He said that that atomic bomb not only killed thousands of people in Hiroshima but also caused unspeakable suffering to survivors.
""Today Hiroshima has been revived,"" the prime minister said, ""and has become a city of culture and prosperity.
""Seventy years on I want to reemphasise the necessity of world peace.""
Mr Abe and Hiroshima Mayor Kazumi Matusi were joined by US Ambassador to Japan Caroline Kennedy for the official ceremony of remembrance on Thursday, which included silent prayers, the release of doves and a declaration of peace.
Mr Matsui described nuclear weapons as an ""absolute evil"" while urging the world to put an end to them forever.
""To coexist we must abolish the... ultimate inhumanity that is nuclear weapons. Now is the time to start taking action,"" he said in his annual speech.
Later in the day, thousands of paper lanterns will be released on the city's Motoyasu River - symbolising the journey to the afterlife of those who died.
The anniversary comes as divisions in Japan rise over Mr Abe's bid to pass unpopular legislation to expand the country's military role worldwide.

"Biffa says that its crews found 93 people sleeping in rubbish last year.
It says the cameras, fitted to 140 of its 800 trucks, would remind staff to check bins before emptying them.
Last year four people sheltering in bins died when they were tipped into the back of trucks.
Biffa's Tim Standring told BBC Radio 4's You and Yours the cameras would give drivers extra ""peace of mind"" and that some vehicles would also record footage from inside hoppers.
The company was not spying on its staff, he said, saying the move was designed to protect them from the ""anguish"" of not realising a person had been inside the bin.
Mr Standring, the firm's divisional health, safety, environment and quality coach, said: ""If it's the only place you've got to stay and it's the most secure place I can kind of see the appeal, but the down side of it is if we don't find you, you're not going to survive.""
He added: ""Once you're in the hopper, the blade comes down and it crushes and breaks the waste and it will take it back into the body [of the vehicle] where it's compacted again.
""These machines won't differentiate between cardboard, wood and unfortunately people as well.""
Biffa hopes that all of its refuse lorries will have the new technology by the end of the year.
The company formed a partnership with the Chartered Institute of Waste Management and homelessness service StreetLink to raise awareness of the issue of people sleeping in bins.
The organisations carried out research last year that showed that 28 of the 176 waste management organisations surveyed reported finding people sheltering in bins over the previous 12 months.",One of the UK's biggest waste companies is fitting cameras to its vehicles in a bid to reduce the number of homeless people killed after sleeping rough in industrial-sized wheelie bins.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"The Gobbins coastal path in Islandmagee was the brainchild of Irish railway engineer Berkley Deane Wise.
It first opened in 1902 and quickly became famous as a white knuckle walk.
Edwardian era visitors were able to have a close encounter with waves and wildlife.
The path, which is carved into black basalt cliffs, was an engineering triumph - it's connected by a network of walkways and bridges - the most iconic of which was the tubular bridge.
Post-war austerity spelt decline for the 1.5 mile walkway and it was closed to the public in the 1950s.
Since then only seabirds have enjoyed the stunning views from this part of our coastline.
Rumblings down the years about restoring the path finally turned into action in 2013, when the restoration project got under way.
Since then, £7.5m has been spent replacing bridges, hand rails and constructing a new visitors centre.
The tubular bridge has been replaced with an almost identical replica.
While modern engineering methods have made the work safer, construction worker Paul Montgomery says he has an enhanced respect for those who built the original path.
""They did an immense job, because the beams I have seen from the old bridges were concrete cased and to get them down here would have been a feat in itself as there were no cranes in those days,"" he said.
""So I have a lot of respect for them.""
While health and safety is more of a concern nowadays some things have not changed, including the steep walk down to the starting point - a hole through rock known as Wise's eye.
Before starting the Gobbins experience, visitors are given a safety briefing and a hard hat in the visitors centre, it's then on to a minibus for the two-mile journey to the path.
The walk is described as strenuous and is not suitable for everyone.
No-one under the height of 1.2m will be permitted, a good level of fitness is required and people with cardiac, respiratory, asthmatic or joint conditions are urged not to attempt it.
The route allows visitors to see coastal birds such as puffins, guillemots and kittiwakes up close. It's also possible to spot porpoises off the coast.
This attraction has created some much needed employment in the area and one of the tour guides is Robert Stewart, a local farmer who has decided to try something new.
""I'm very enthusiastic about my new job,"" he said.
""Everybody knows about the Giant's Causeway but I think we have something here that can compete with the Giant's Causeway and is just as beautiful.""
Groups of 10 to 15 will be guided along the bridges which cling to the cliff face just metres above the sea.
Tours should be booked in advance and the costs are £8.50 for adults, concessions £6 and a family rate of £23.
There will also be a cliff top walk which will be free for the public and has a viewing platform that hangs over the cliff.  This element of the work is not expected to be complete until September.
The project is over a year late and £1.5m over budget, but Mid and East Antrim Council has big hopes for the attraction and is expecting 50,000 visitors a year.
Tourism Minister Jonathan Bell, who walked the path on Tuesday, said it was ""staggeringly beautiful"".
""It is something that you could bring visitors from anywhere in the world to and be very proud of the quality of the tourism offering,"" he said.
""Having done it, I think it represents real value for money and puts Northern Ireland with another - and I genuinely mean this -  top quality, international tourist destination.""
The council's mayor Billy Ashe said it was fantastic for the area.
""I think that first and foremost it will put us back on the map,"" he said.
""Berkley Deane Wise thought that this path could be one of the world's attractions - I agree with him.
""I think people will be coming here for many, many, many years to feast their eyes on this marvellous achievement.""",A dramatic cliff face walk in County Antrim that was built more than a century ago has reopened to the public after multi-million pound revamp.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Jason Woodward's try put them ahead but Josh Bassett, Tommy Taylor and Joe Simpson scored as Wasps went in ahead.
Christian Wade, Guy Thompson and Bassett went over for the visitors for a bonus point, which deflated Bristol.
The hosts rallied, Jack O'Connell and Nick Fenton-Wells touching down, but it could not stop them from going down.
Having finished top of the Championship in five seasons before finally winning promotion in the play-offs last year, Bristol will return to the second-tier at the first time of asking.
After Worcester's win over Bath on Saturday, Mark Tainton's Bristol needed two points from the game to prolong their relegation battle, but they lacked a clinical streak.
It leaves them 12 points adrift at the bottom of the table, with a maximum of 10 points on offer from their final two matches.
Wasps were far from at their best, on the back foot for much of the game, but have restored their five-point lead at the top and need one win from their last two to secure a home semi-final in the play-offs.
The Premiership's top try-scorer Wade, on his 100th appearance for Dai Young's side, did his England hopes no harm with his 16th score of the campaign.
Bristol were promoted to the top tier on 25 May after winning their two-legged play-off final, with the Premiership season starting just 100 days later.
Director of rugby Andy Robinson, a former England head coach, was sacked in November after his side lost their first 10 games of the campaign.
Tainton took interim charge and Bristol finally got their first league win against Worcester on Boxing Day, following it up with victory at Sale and a losing bonus point at Northampton, but it was a false dawn.
The scrapping of the Championship play-offs, meaning the team that finishes top will gain automatic promotion, may give Bristol more time to plan ahead next season if they are successful.
Connacht boss Pat Lam will have the task of bringing Bristol back into the Premiership, having signed a three-year deal in December to become head coach from June.
Tainton will remain at the helm for their final two matches at Saracens and at home to Newcastle, and remains optimistic about the future of the club.
""Obviously it's disappointing to get relegated, but we've put a plan in place whether we were going to stay in the Premiership or get relegated,"" he said.
""We have the infrastructure at Ashton Gate to be a Premiership team - we're not going to be next year, but hopefully the supporters will still watch us in that league.
""Bristol more than most know what a difficult league it (the Championship) is, but hopefully we can bounce back very quickly.""
Bristol interim head coach Mark Tainton:
""It was a similar story to a lot of games - we've created an awful lot, we've been in the opposition 22 many times but we've just not executed and got across the line.
""We give Wasps an opportunity and they score tries, it's as simple as that - that's the difference in the level we need to get to.
""We were down and beaten in the second half but we played right until the very end of the game - I expect that from them in the next two games.""
Wasps director of rugby Dai Young:
""Obviously there are still things to work on, especially our starts - I thought our first 10 minutes, again, we made far too many mistakes and gave ourselves a bit of a hill to climb.
""We just had enough to do it but we make it hard for us really - there's room to improve in every area, but I'm pretty pleased and felt we looked in control for most of the game.
""It's up to us to nail it (a top-two finish) ourselves - we're not relying on other people.""

"Virginia Raggi said more arrivals could exacerbate social tension.
Her call follows local elections on Sunday in which the Five Star Movement performed poorly.
More than 500,000 people have arrived by boat since 2014. Nearly 200,000 are being housed in  centres across the country.
""We cannot permit the creation of more social tensions,"" Ms Raggi said on Facebook.
""That is why I am saying it is impossible, risky even, to think about creating any new reception structures.""
The interior ministry has asked all Italian municipalities to find space for an expected 250,000 new migrants this year, up from about 180,000 last year.
Some observers say Ms Raggi is attempting to win back support by targeting migrants after her party failed to make the run-off in 24 of the main 25 cities choosing a new mayor.
About half of Italians do not want the country to take in more people, pollster Renato Mannheimer told Reuters news agency.
Italy is accommodating rising numbers of migrants because countries to the north have tightened their borders and some EU states have refused to take part in a plan to relocate 160,000 people from Italy and Greece.
Just over 20,000 migrants have so far been relocated under the plan and the EU has begun legal action against against Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic for refusing to accept refugees.
An estimated 40% of the migrants in Italy have a valid claim to asylum or leave to remain on humanitarian grounds, AFP news agency reported.
The others are deemed to be illegal economic migrants and face deportation, but this can be difficult to arrange in practice because their countries of origin sometimes refuse to take them back.
A note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.","The mayor of Rome, who is from the anti-establishment Five Star Movement, has asked Italy's government not to send more migrants to the city.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Roche was also second in the overall standings, six seconds behind Voeckler.
Bury's Adam Yates (Orica) was Britain's highest finisher, as he was third in the stage and fourth overall.
Sunday's final stage, a 198km route from Middlesbrough to Scarborough, contained six categorised climbs.
Team Sky set a punishing pace in wet and gruelling conditions after taking it on at half distance and with 44km to go they had five riders at the head of the leading group.
Roche attacked on the ascent at Harwood Dale and took with them Voeckler, Yates, Anthony Turgis (Cofidis) and Steven Kruijswijk (LottoNL).
It was Voeckler who clung on the to back of Roche as the Team Sky sprinter attacked again in the descent into Scarborough.
Voeckler, who finished third last year after missing out in a sprint finish, used that experience to employ some cat and mouse tactics, as he tracked Roche along the resort's seafront in front of huge crowds on the town's famous grass banks.
Roche suffered a momentary lapse in concentration, causing him to look the wrong way as Voeckler flew past him with the finishing line in sight to leave his rival in his wake.
Voeckler told ITV4: ""It wasn't just with the strength in my legs that I used, but also my head.
""It was difficult to follow the attack of Team Sky at the climbs, so I decided on a little more patience.
""Then I knew to launch the sprint at 300 metres. Although it was early, with the wind at my back, it was not so bad.""

The Low Pay Commission says that excluding apprenticeships there were 1.3 million jobs in 2014 that paid the National Minimum Wage (NMW) of which 40% were full-time, so that's about 520,000 jobs.
Assuming everyone earned the highest level of minimum wage, the average level of the NMW for 2013-14 was £6.25.
If we assume that they worked 37.5 hours a week (that's the average number of full-time hours given in the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings for 2014) and that they work 48 weeks a year, their total earnings come to £5.9bn, which is less than half the amount paid in bonuses by the finance and insurance sector - it's about 40%.
Before you go and buy a pitchfork, remember that there are differences between this figure and the US one. For example, the bonuses in the UK finance and insurance sector were shared between more than a million employees - considerably more than on Wall Street. There were people paid very high bonuses but also people paid much more modest ones. The average overall was £13,300, but I would expect that to mask quite a range.
But the other question is, what is this an indicator for and what would make it rise or fall?
So, for example, imagine that 100,000 people earning minimum wage suddenly received a pay rise of £1 an hour. They would no longer be earning minimum wage, so the total amount paid to workers on the minimum wage would fall considerably and as a result the amount paid out in bonuses would be a higher multiple of it. But it would be hard to argue that their pay rise had increased inequality.
Nonetheless, if you were outraged by the figure from the US then you will be just as outraged that the same appears to be true in the UK.",A statistic in March provoked outrage in the US media about inequality.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The force said mental health issues resulted in 141,230 lost days among front-line officers.
The Liberal Democrats said the figures showed evidence of a force ""being stretched to breaking point"".
The Scottish government said the welfare of officers and support staff was taken ""very seriously"".
Police Scotland released the figures to the Lib Dems under Freedom of Information laws.
The party's justice spokesman Liam McArthur said police officers and civilian staff were not getting the support they needed from the Scottish government.
He said: ""The savings that were promised by the SNP before the creation of Police Scotland have not materialised.
""As a result, officers and civilian staff are being asked to do more and more with less. With the chief constable warning that further cuts are coming, the pressure on staff is only likely to get worse.""
He added: ""We have already seen staff surveys which show morale is at rock bottom. The shortages are affecting the health of officers and civilian staff and these new figures are a huge concern.
""Policing is a high-stress profession at the best of times. The changes that the SNP forced through are stretching the mental health of officers and civilian staff to breaking point.
""This means giving police management the freedom to put resources where they are needed.
""Extra money is also required to plug the hole in the national force's budget and avert the loss of staff which would only put those remaining further under the cosh.""
A Scottish government spokesman said Police Scotland would be expected to have ""robust policies"" in place to support staff and manage their health at work.
The spokesman added: ""They have a number of targeted activities to support wellbeing and occupational health across the organisation.
""We have committed to protecting the police revenue budget in real terms, safeguarding policing from Westminster budget cuts and delivering an additional Â£100m of investment by the end of this parliament, in addition to Â£55m of reform funding in 2016-17.""

""We also ensure all officers and staff have access to a range of support options, including an appropriate independent occupational health service which can be tailored to individual needs.

"Current Yes keyboardist Geoff Downes tweeted: ""Utterly devastated beyond words to have to report the sad news of the passing of my dear friend, bandmate and inspiration Chris Squire.""
Squire had revealed he was suffering from a rare form of leukaemia.
The band said he died ""peacefully"" in Phoenix, Arizona, on Saturday night.
""It's with the heaviest of hearts and unbearable sadness that we must inform you of the passing of our dear friend and Yes co-founder, Chris Squire,"" a statement on the band's official Facebook page said.
Squire had revealed in May that he had been recently diagnosed with acute erythroid leukemia, which would force him to miss the band's summer co-headlining tour with Toto.
Yes were formed in 1968 when singer Jon Anderson met self-taught bassist Squire in London.
Their big break came a year later when they signed to Atlantic Records after opening for Janis Joplin at London's Royal Albert Hall. Their debut single, Sweetness, and first album, Yes, were released later that year.
Other albums included 1971's Fragile, 1972's Close To The Edge and 1977's Going For The One.
In 1983 they released the album 90125, which featured their classic hit Owner Of A Lonely Heart. That went on to become a US number one hit in January 1984 despite only reaching number 28 in their home country.
Squire also released a solo album, Fish Out Of Water, in 1975.
The group's most recent studio album, Heaven & Earth, came out last year.
Squire, who was born in Kingsbury, north-west London, was the only member of the group to feature on every studio album.
Musicians and fans took to Twitter and Facebook to pay tribute to Squire.
John Petrucci, founding member and guitarist for American progressive metal band Dream Theater, tweeted: ""Thank you for all of the amazing music Chris Squire. You will surely be missed.""
Rage Against the Machine guitarist Tom Morello tweeted: ""RIP Chris Squire, super bassist of Yes. An extremely talented musician's musician who mastered his instrument and took it to new realms.""
American rock guitarist Joe Satriani posted: ""R.I.P. and thank you Chris Squire. #ChrisSquire,#yes""

"The Blues, who had keeper Thibaut Courtois sent off, were down to nine men for a period after staff ran on to treat Hazard following a trip, despite him not appearing to be badly injured.
If a player receives treatment, they must leave the field.
""I was unhappy with my medical staff. They were impulsive and naive,"" Mourinho told Sky Sports.
""Whether you are a kit man, doctor or secretary on the bench you have to understand the game.
""You have to know you have one player less and to assist a player you must be sure he has a serious problem. I was sure Eden did not have a serious problem. He had a knock. He was tired.""
Chelsea were already struggling to cope against Swansea's extra man before Hazard was tripped by Gylfi Sigurdsson with six minutes remaining, leading to Mourinho's frustration.
It was an eventful match for Premier League champions Chelsea. Courtois suffered an injury scare in the warm-up before he was was dismissed in the 52nd minute after bringing down Swansea striker Bafetimbi Gomis.
Replacement goalkeeper Asmir Begovic came on for his debut after an £8m move from Stoke, with opening goalscorer Oscar making way. Gomis scored the resulting penalty.
""I don't want to talk about it,"" Mourinho said of the referee's decision.
After Oscar's opener, Andre Ayew equalised on his Swansea debut but the visitors only held on for 95 seconds before Federico Fernandez scored an unfortunate own goal to gift Chelsea a 2-1 lead.
Following defeat by Arsenal in last Sunday's Community Shield, Chelsea again looked rusty, having returned from a pre-season tour of North America where they travelled 9,800 miles.
Mourinho said: ""Swansea didn't have chances against 11 men. The team was playing very, very well in the first half.
""In one minute, it was a penalty, red card and the goal.
""If you have 10 men and are winning you can defend well and try to find a strategy but to play with 10 men and try to win the game is more difficult. I would say we were the best team with 11 players and with 10 we fought hard, some fighting at the limit of their condition.""

"Last year, Beijing banned any more ""bizarre"" buildings. In recent years the country has seen buildings shaped like a teapot and another resembling a pair of trousers.
Now, China's State Administration for Industry and Commerce has continued the government's crusade for normalcy with restrictions on such names as 'scared of wife' or 'prehistoric powers'.
So, just how weird and wonderful are Chinese company names? Well, a few otherwise-unoccupied social media users in China have dug up some gems.
Some curiosities have crept into business names from internet memes.
""Shenyang Prehistoric Powers Hotel Management Limited Company"" might sound weird but less so to Chinese sports fans who remember swimmer Fu Yuanhui.
She famously won a bronze medal at the Rio Olympics, afterwards declaring: ""I have used all my prehistoric powers to swim!""
There are also lots of restaurants and cafes with the phrase ""skinny blue mushroom"".
The phrase originated from a meme which mocked a man from Guangxi province who uploaded a video of himself talking about his loneliness while his girlfriend was away.
""Unbearable, I want to cry,"" he moaned - but thanks to his accent, it ended up sounding more like ""skinny blue mushroom"".
One of the best known offbeat names on Chinese social media is a condom company called ""Uncle Niu"".
Or, more accurately, ""There Is a Group of Young People With Dreams, Who Believe They Can Make the Wonders of Life Under the Leadership of Uncle Niu Internet Technology Co Ltd.""
It's not concise, but at least it's positive.
Others aren't so upbeat, especially when it comes to home life.
And given ""Beijing Scared of Wife Technology Company"" and ""Anping County Scared of Wife Netting Products Factory"" are both registered companies, the trend doesn't seem to be limited by industry or region.
The rules of written Chinese are vastly different to those of written English, so many names seem far stranger in translation than in the original tongue.
English names can seem pretty strange in Chinese too, and there's a cottage industry among branding agencies to help western companies come up with names for the Chinese market.
Western company names often follow the name of their founder (think Boeing, Ford or Gucci), which might have no direct translation.
Or they might be a concocted portmanteau (think Verizon, which is the Latin word ""veritas"" meaning truth, with horizon bolted on to the end) or maybe even just tech nonsense (Etsy, Hulu).
""What we think is most important to come up with a name that captures the spirit of the brand,"" says Tait Lawton, from Nanjing Marketing Group, which provides naming services.
Western companies sometimes try to phonetically replicate the original, or come up with a Chinese name that's fairly neutral in meaning.
Others will come up with a new name that tries other ways of encapsulating the brand.
""BMW's current Chinese name is 宝马. It's great. The first character means 'treasure' and the second character means 'horse'. The sound is 'bao ma', starting with a B and M. Plus, it's short. It just has a great feel to it,"" says Mr Lawton.
He has a few other examples he likes too.
Pampers, for example, is 帮宝适 or ""bang bao shi"", which means ""helps make baby comfortable"".
Walch soap 威露士 or ""wei lu shi"" loosely translates as ""mighty liquid guard"", and who wouldn't want to wash with that?",China has banned companies from registering weird and long names.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The country is going through its toughest economic situation since the hyper-inflation of 2008.
Speaking to parliament on Thursday, Finance Minister Patrick Chinamasa said that currently the government wage bill takes up nearly 97% of the revenue it receives.
He hopes to bring that figure down to 75% by the end of next year.

Last year, Mr Chinamasa made similar proposals which were then blocked by the cabinet.

"Eight Type 26 frigates are due to be built on the Clyde, but the UK government has not announced a timescale for the project.
Harriet Baldwin faced calls from SNP and Labour MPs to confirm a time-frame for cutting steel on the frigates.
But she said it would be ""inappropriate"" to do so as negotiations continue.
Work had originally been due to start this year, but SNP defence spokesman Brendan O'Hara predicted during a Commons debate on Tuesday that construction of the ships would not start until at least the summer of next year.
He also said the delays could be in part blamed on the economic impact of Brexit, as well as the government committing too much of its procurement budget to renewing the Trident nuclear deterrent.
Mr O'Hara told MPs: ""It would be an unforgivable betrayal of the Clyde workers if they were the ones that had to pay the price of Brexit, but also the price of Trident.""
In reply, Ms Baldwin told the Westminster Hall debate: ""The timing of the award of the build contract and the build schedule itself are key components of the ongoing commercial negotiations between the Government and BAE Systems.
""We are negotiating a deal that aims to optimise the requirements of the Royal Navy in terms of the capability the ships will deliver, to achieve value for money for defence and the taxpayer, and to deliver a build schedule that drives performance.
""These negotiations are continuing, so I am not this afternoon in a position to give a specific date as to when an agreement will be reached.
""To protect the commercial interests of the Ministry of Defence, disclosing any such detail would be inappropriate at this time.""
Under questioning from the SNP's Chris Stephens, Ms Baldwin confirmed the national ship building strategy will report by the time of the Autumn Statement on 23 November, which could reveal fresh information about plans for the Type 26 frigates.
Ms Baldwin also resisted calls to disclose further reasons behind delays and cuts to the project.
The project has already been cut from 13 to eight new ships, while a target to start cutting steel in May has been delayed indefinitely.
Tory MP Bob Stewart, a former British Army officer, said: ""I don't think we need the minister to answer that - the answer is we had no money.
""That's why we had to cut down the number of Type 26 ships. We did not have the money, and we actually had to cut our means to suit our coat.""

Norris first came to prominence in 2001 with his production of Afore Night Come at the Young Vic, for which he won the Evening Standard award for most promising newcomer.
Having initially trained at Rada as an actor, the 48-year-old has since directed theatre in the West End and on Broadway, as well as having experience with opera and film.
In 2012 his film Broken premiered at the Cannes Film Festival before winning best British independent film at the British Independent Film Awards.

""The key with him is that he can direct at the Olivier (The Amen Corner, London Road, Death and the King's Horseman) and on a smaller scale at The Shed (Table).
""He's proved he has the ability to direct across the board.""

""The theatre's in a different place from when Nick [Hytner] took over - a position of strength.""
Norris revealed he was directing a movie version of London Road in 2014, but said he would be ""100% committed to this building"" from the moment Sir Nicholas leaves.
""I'm not going to kid myself. I will be chained to this place,"" he added.
Norris, who has been an associate director at the National Theatre since 2011, will take up his new position from April 2015.
He is the first former actor as well as non-Oxbridge graduate to be appointed since Sir Laurence Olivier, who was the National's first artistic director in 1963.
""There have been many times in my life when I've regretted that I played in bands and was a painter decorator for four years when I could have been at university, but I seem to be here - it worked out,"" Norris said.
""The simple fact is, lots of people who go to Oxford and Cambridge are very, very clever. That doesn't mean they're the only clever people.""
The National Theatre's chairman John Makinson said: ""The Board looked for an individual with a creative reputation that would command the respect and support of British theatre, and with the generosity of spirit that has characterised Nick Hytner's period as director.
""Rufus Norris has both those qualities in abundance. He is an exciting choice, someone who will build on the National Theatre's present reputation as one of the most admired and innovative performing arts organisations in the world.
""We are fortunate that he has chosen to join us.""
The National Theatre's first director from 1963-73 was Sir Laurence Olivier, who is widely considered to be one of the greatest actors of all time.
When asked by the BBC's Arts Editor Will Gompertz whether he thought his acting past would also bring a different flavour to the institution, Norris laughed: ""It's an interesting question and one I had not anticipated at all, because to compare me as an actor with Laurence Olivier is one of the funniest things I've heard in a long time.""
He continued: ""I'm sure that what I bring to it will be nothing like the amount of skill and expertise that his acting career allowed him to bring to the table.
""But I think, yeah, training as an actor and having that experience for a while gives you an insight into a certain aspect of the process which is very, very useful.""
Sir Kenneth Branagh, Stephen Daldry, Danny Boyle and ex-Donmar Warehouse bosses Michael Grandage and Sam Mendes had all been in the frame for the job, although Mendes had ruled himself out of the race.
Nick Starr, the theatre's executive director since 2002, also announced he would be leaving the NT during 2014, leading to a phased handover of the top jobs.",Rufus Norris is to take over from Sir Nicholas Hytner as director of the National Theatre.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The Endeavour project has bought a former German harbour ferry for £1 with the hope of raising £3m to restore the 59-year-old rusting vessel.
A service used to link Liverpool with the Welsh resort, while en route to the Isle of Man, 30 years ago.
""The money is coming from some private investors,"" said restorer Steve Payne.
""We have some fund-raising ourselves and then we've had some bequests come in as well.""
The 55-metre long vessel, first launched in Hamburg in 1958, has been rusting in Liverpool docks since 1994 when an attempt to turn her into a floating bar on Liverpool's famous Albert Dock failed.
Enthusiasts, headed by Mr Payne, saved her from scrap in 2016 with the dream of offering three-hour summer day trips for up to 450 people from Liverpool to Llandudno.
The Endeavour's two diesel engines will have to be refurbished while the lifeboats have been sent to Norway for an overhaul.
Many of the ship's fittings need replacing and even the ship's wheel has been stolen.
""If we were to build a ship this size, new at the moment, we'd be looking around £25m-£30m,"" said Mr Payne, secretary of the Liverpool and North Wales Steam Ship Company.
""We have the basis of a very, very good ship here.""
Mr Payne is confident the new limited company can meet the health and safety requirements necessary to allow The Endeavour leave her berth in Liverpool's Canada Dock again.
The Endeavour has no history of sailing in British waters but Mr Payne believes she is the ideal ship for traditional summer day trippers.
""You can't find ships like this any more,"" he said.
""There's not a major UK connection but we want to establish a new connection for this ship so children can have a chance to experience this in 25 years time the way their grandparents did.""",A ferry between Llandudno to Liverpool could be restarted by the summer of 2021 as a group of enthusiasts hope to reopen the once-popular day trip.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The firm told a judicial review it did not accept the discharge of final treated effluent had degraded the quality of Llyn Padarn at Llanberis.
Anglers claim water quality threatens the future of the Arctic char fish.
A High Court judge reserved judgement in the case at Caernarfon on Wednesday.
The judicial review proceedings have been brought by the Seiont, Gwyrfai, and Llyfni Anglers Society, represented by a body called Fish Legal - an umbrella organisation for fishing groups.
Lawyers claimed Natural Resources Wales (NRW) had not done enough to protect the Arctic char, primarily from raw sewage and treated effluent discharged by Welsh Water.
The company said since 2010 it had invested £3.6m at the works, with another £4.6m agreed to be spent by summer 2016.
It said the work completed meant the lake met water quality standards necessary to be awarded bathing water status by the Welsh government.
""It is not accepted that the discharge of final treated effluent has degraded the lake as alleged by the society, or caused damage to fish stocks,"" its statement  added.","More than £4.5m is to be spent at a water treatment works near a Snowdonia lake to improve the quality of water returned to the environment, Welsh Water has said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The Kenyan trade unionist turned politician Tom Mboya, who studied at Ruskin College, Oxford, wanted members of his country's government to be adequately prepared for a post-colonial Kenya.
He recognised quite early on that there were not enough professional Africans to run an efficient civil service.
To make up the shortfall, he set up a scholarship fund that would take young bright Africans to the US and Canada.
The idea was for them to acquire the necessary skills and come back to help build a new country when the white civil servants packed up and returned to Europe.
One of those students was one Barack Obama from Kogelo, near the port city of Kisumu on the shores of Lake Victoria.
Barack Obama Senior was the first African student to study at the University of Hawaii.
There he fell in love and married a young American woman, Ann Dunham. They had a son named after his father, Barack Hussein Obama II.
I travelled to Mr Obama's home in Kogelo where I met his step-grandmother Sarah Obama and aunt Marsat Onyango Obama to find out what the scholarship meant for the family at the time.
We stood in the family's small graveyard, next to the grave of Barack Obama Senior.
Ms Onyango told me that even though she had not yet been born when Mr Obama left, she knew that the family had been very proud of him.
""They said he carried their hopes and dreams.""
Tom Mboya was assassinated in central Nairobi 1969 at the age of 38.
He was minister of economic development and planning but the motive for his killing remains a mystery.
He had achieved a lot for his young age - his intellectual prowess and eloquence meant that he could articulate his vision clearly to others.
As a sign of his global significance he had appeared on the cover of Time magazine, the first Kenyan to have done so.
One of his daughters, Susan Mboya, who holds a PhD in chemistry, is an executive at Coca-Cola Africa based in Nairobi.
She also runs a scholarship programme, known as Zawadi, the Kiswahili word for gift, helping mainly young African women to study abroad.
In light of the excitement engulfing Kenya ahead of President Obama's visit this weekend, I asked what she thought of her father's initiative.
She replied in a quiet, confident voice: ""My father could not have known that by helping one person to go to school, he was going to change the lives of so many people.
""Barack Obama has achieved a lot personally and it's great that he is the president of the United States.
""But I think the biggest benefit that Barack Obama has brought is how he has inspired young people all over the worldâ€¦ and to me that is the huge thing that has come out of the scholarships.""
I asked her why she had followed in her father's footsteps by setting up her own programme.
""I want to finish what my father started but I want to finish it in a way that brings balance to the leadership in this country.""
The airlift scholarship also took the Kenyan newspaper columnist Philip Ochieng to America.
He studied a Bachelor of Arts in Literature at Chicago's Roosevelt University.
The 76-year-old knew Mr Obama Senior very well and recalls that he was clever.
He told me in Nairobi that they used to drink whisky together.
As he put it: ""America watered my thirst for knowledge.""
What if
The scholarship programme educated nearly 800 students from Kenya and elsewhere in East Africa.
Other scholars included the late Wangari Mathaai, who became the first African woman to become a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, and the late geneticist Reuben Olembo, who became a director at the United Nations environment agency, Unep.
The partner, on the other side of the Atlantic, was an American entrepreneur William X Scheinman, who was a good friend of Tom Mboya's, and they received President John F Kennedy's support.
Musician and activist Harry Belafonte and actor Sidney Poitier raised funds for the scholarship fund, amongst many others.
Mr Belafonte later wrote about Mr Obama Senior's scholarship: ""Imagine: perhaps, if not for support from the African American Students' Foundation, he might not have come to America,"" he said.
""Then who would be in the White House today?""
Mr Obama Senior, who also graduated from Harvard, returned to Kenya in 1968 and eventually worked for the government as an economist.
He died in a car crash in 1982.
But not before he had visited his son in Hawaii.
He gave his son his first basketball as a gift and took him to his first jazz concert, where the maestro pianist and composer Dave Brubeck was performing.
And as I left her office in Nairobi, which boasts pictures of when she met President Obama, Ms Mboya reminded me ""it doesn't take much to change a life.""","This is where the story of America's first black president, Barack Obama, begins.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Culture Minister Ali Jannati said flights would only resume once those responsible had been punished.
The teenagers allege that before returning to Tehran from the Umra, or lesser Islamic pilgrimage, in March they were abused by security officials at Jeddah airport.
The move is likely to deepen tensions between the two regional powers.
They are currently at odds over the conflict in Yemen, where a coalition led by Sunni Muslim-ruled Saudi Arabia is carrying out air strikes on Shia Houthi rebels, which the US says are receiving military assistance from Iran. Iran and the Houthis deny this.
On Saturday, hundreds of people protested outside the Saudi embassy in Tehran and demanded that the Iranian government ""end the unnecessary Umra"".
On Monday, Mr Jannati told state television: ""I have ordered the Hajj and Pilgrimage Organisation to suspend the Umra until the criminals are tried and punished.""
""Considering what has happened, Iranians' dignity has been damaged and a public demand has formed,"" he added.
The minister said Saudi officials had ""promised to punish the persons in custody"".
""They even asserted that they would execute them, but nothing has been done in reality so far.""
Each year about 500,000 Iranians undertake the Umra, an optional pilgrimage that can be undertaken at any time of the year other than during the main pilgrimage, or Hajj.

"It also proclaimed the group's leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, as caliph and ""leader for Muslims everywhere"".
Setting up a state governed under strict Islamic law has long been a goal of many jihadists.
Meanwhile, Iraq's army continued an offensive to retake the northern city of Tikrit from the Isis-led rebels.
The city was seized by the insurgents on 11 June as they swept across large parts of north-western Iraq.
In a separate development, Israel called for the creation of an independent Kurdish state in response to the gain made by the Sunni rebels in Iraq.
The Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (Isis) announced the establishment of the caliphate in an audio recording posted on the internet on Sunday.
Isis also said that from now on it would be known simply as ""the Islamic State"".
The BBC's Middle East editor, Jeremy Bowen, says the declaration harks back to the rise of Islam, when the Prophet Muhammad's followers conquered vast territories in the Middle Ages.
The Sunni-Shia split has its origins in a dispute over the succession to Muhammad.
It's easy to dismiss the latest crop of Isis videos and statements as mere propaganda (however well produced), but the announcement of the establishment of a caliphate is rich with religious, cultural and historic significance.
Generations of Sunni radicals have dreamt of a moment when, in the words of Isis spokesman Abu Muhammad al-Adnani, Muslims ""shake off the dust of humiliation and disgrace"" and a new caliphate rises out of the chaos, confusion and despair of the modern Middle East.
Many Sunnis, and all Shia, will recoil in horror from the barbarism that has accompanied this moment, but the sight of old colonial-era boundaries being erased is a powerful statement, designed to attract new recruits to this whirlwind jihad.
In one of the Isis videos uploaded on Sunday, a bearded fighter called Abu Safiyya guides the viewer around a newly demolished border post. The video, with its arresting imagery and impressive production values, is designed to electrify the group's followers.
The fact that Abu Safiyya is described as being from Chile merely adds to what the authors hope is now the organisation's global appeal.
Isis said the Islamic state would extend from Aleppo in northern Syria to Diyala province in eastern Iraq.
Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the group said, would become the leader of the state and would be known as ""Caliph Ibrahim"".
In the recording, the rebels also demanded that all Muslims ""pledge allegiance"" to the new ruler and ""reject democracy and other garbage from the West"".
On Sunday, Iraqi government jets struck at rebel positions and clashes broke out in various parts of Tikrit, witnesses and officials said.
""The security forces are advancing from different areas"", Lt-Gen Qassem Atta told journalists. ""There are ongoing clashes.""
Troops had reportedly pulled back to the nearby town of Dijla as Saturday's initial offensive met stiff resistance.
The heavy fighting over the two days caused many casualties on both sides, eyewitnesses and journalists told the BBC.
Insurgents were reported to have shot down a helicopter and captured the pilot.
Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called for the creation of an independent Kurdish state in response to gains made by Sunni insurgents in Iraq.
In a speech in Tel Aviv, he said the Kurds were ""a nation of fighters and have proved political commitment and are worthy of independence"".
The Kurds have long striven for an independent state but they remain divided between Syria and Turkey, Iran and Iraq.

"Look into their jaundiced eyes, listen to their weary words and you enter a world of crossed-out, ripped-up, stomped-upon storylines.
So sup up the youthful vigour of Great Britain's glorious Olympians Anthony Joshua and Luke Campbell while you can. Because the flavour might run out before long.
""You get back from an Olympics and you're hot property,"" says James DeGale, who won gold for Britain at the 2008 Games in Beijing.
""I'd done my country proud, I signed for the biggest promoter in Europe in Frank Warren. But after my first professional fight, when I got booed, I thought to myself: 'Right, this ain't all glitz and glamour. That stuff fades, this is some serious stuff.'""
On 16 November, DeGale fights Dyah Davis at the Bluewater shopping centre in Kent. Vegas it isn't. Almost five years, 17 fights and plenty of lumps and bumps into his professional career, the promised land still seems a long way off.
""I definitely thought I'd have fought for a world title by now,"" adds the 27-year-old, who at least has terrestrial television exposure on Channel 5.
""But with politics and problems with promoters [DeGale left Warren for Mick Hennessy last September], things slowed down a touch. Pro boxing's not just a sport, it's a business - the hardest business in the world.""
No British Olympic boxing champion has won a professional world title. Chris Finnegan, who struck gold in 1968, came closest, losing in valiant fashion to American light-heavyweight great Bob Foster in 1972.
Media playback is not supported on this device
Sydney 2000 champion Audley Harrison entered the pro ranks believing the medal dangling from his neck doubled as an amulet but soon discovered that gold grows old, like any other colour.
Errol Christie never competed at an Olympics but he was one of Britain's finest amateur talents, our very own Sugar Ray Leonard. But three years into his paid career he was all but washed up and never fought for a pro title. ""Christie's heart,"" it was written, ""sets questions his chin can't answer.""
Frankie Gavin was billed as a modern-day Christie - only better. Balletic foot movement, exquisite balance, the kid from Birmingham had pretty much everything. And still does, it's just that he momentarily lost it along the way.
""In the end it was so easy for me as an amateur,"" says Gavin, who missed out on the 2008 Olympics after failing to make the weight but remains the only British boxer to win a world amateur title.
""I won my last 50 fights, everything was done for me at GB Boxing in Sheffield and when you're part of a team you can help each other. But when you turn pro you're on your own. I didn't realise how lonely it would be.""
An unhappy boxer tends to be an underperforming boxer and loneliness exacerbated by personal turmoil made Gavin a very unhappy boxer indeed.
""I took my family up to Manchester and it was all right for a bit,"" says the 28-year-old. ""But when I split up from my girlfriend I was doing it all on my own. And I was even lonelier.""
Besides his relationship ending in acrimonious circumstances, Gavin's grandmother died and his mother was diagnosed with cancer. In addition, Gavin felt unloved by some of those charged with guiding his career.
""I remember almost falling over in front of one trainer,"" says Gavin, ""and he said: 'I'm glad you didn't go over, that might have been my investment gone, my 10%.' It made me think.
""I was on the brink of giving it all up. I said to Frank Warren: 'I'll get back in touch if I want to box again.'""
Sitting next to Gavin, with his eyes wide open and his ears cocked, is his old team-mate Anthony Ogogo, a bronze medallist at the London Olympics.
Ogogo, on the books of American giants Golden Boy Promotions, is three fights into his pro career and as bushy-tailed as boxers come. But even he is becoming pitted by the game's hard truths.
""I've never seen anyone as talented as Frankie,"" says the 24-year-old. ""So it's weird to think it could have been all over almost before it started.
""Then again, you hear so many horror stories in boxing - strife with promoters, trainers or managers. It's a hard enough game without all that so you need to know you've got the right people around you. People you can trust.""
You hear so many horror stories in boxing - strife with promoters, trainers or managers. It's a hard enough game without all that.
Boxers are wont to blame everyone but themselves for their lack of progress. So it is refreshing to hear Gavin admitting his own mistakes and that he has taken steps to rectify them. Starting with getting the right people around him. People he can trust.
""I got complacent because it all seemed too easy again, starting out in the pro ranks,"" says Gavin. ""I thought all I had to do was box - pads, spar, pads, spar. But you've got to work on your weaknesses as well as your strengths.
""Fighters I should have been smashing up I was having hard fights against, like Curtis Woodhouse. But when I went back to Birmingham my old amateur trainer, Tom Chaney, took over again.
""He's like a father figure to me. He doesn't nag me for money if I don't pay him on time - he's not in it for money, he's in it for me.""
Head settled and body a temple once more, Gavin is now the British and Commonwealth welterweight champion and confident enough to be calling out Kell Brook and Amir Khan.
DeGale, too, is ""older and wiser"". Free of hangers-on, less bombastic but painfully aware he remains lumbered with something of an image problem.
""I learned a whole heap from my loss against George Groves,"" says DeGale of his only pro defeat, by his bitter domestic rival in 2011.
""During the build-up I was a bit too vocal, telling him he was ugly and his breath smelt. Maybe I shouldn't have said that.
""I read and hear people saying I'm flash and cocky and it does hurt a bit. Maybe it's just me being me. But the people who know me realise I'm a genuine, humble, down-to-earth boy.""
Ogogo may have his eyes wide open and both ears cocked - ""James and Frankie have made mistakes I don't want to make"" - but the chain of advice is unbroken from the time men first laced up gloves and the same mistakes get made. Over and over again.
Proof that professional boxing isn't a sport, it isn't a business, it's a series of accidents - rather than mistakes - just waiting to happen.
""I get a lot of stick,"" says DeGale, a former British and European super-middleweight champion and one or two fights away from a world title shot.
""People telling me I'm greedy, that I'm always thinking about money, that I've messed up my career. But they don't understand. I love boxing, but it's hard, it's a short career and I want to get paid as much as I can and get out with my faculties intact.
""I tell young fighters who train with me: 'Get in there, make some money and run.'"" Which almost never happens. Not even if you turn up for your first day of work with a medal round your neck.
""It's always there,"" says DeGale, ""I'm always 'James Degale, Olympic champion'. But another Olympics comes around, new medallists arrive and they start taking the limelight.""

"Mr Haigh has been accused of fraud by the Dubai-based group and is currently in custody while authorities decide whether to pursue a criminal case.
Speaking from his cell, he told the BBC he would reveal ""damaging allegations"" about the group's financial conduct.
GFH Capital said it could not comment on ""general accusations"".
Mr Haigh, 36, was employed by GFH when it purchased Leeds United in December 2012 but resigned as an employee following the club's takeover in April.
Speaking exclusively from the Dubai police cell, he claimed one allegation about GFH concerned the run-up to the purchase of Leeds United from Ken Bates for more than Â£17m in December 2012.
A GFH Capital spokesman said: ""GFH cannot and will not comment on such general allegations, and is concerned about Mr Haigh's protestations of being unable to engage with the claim against him while apparently being able to brief the media at will.""
The allegations were contained in a dossier compiled by Mr Haigh ""about GFH's professional conduct and practices"", according to a statement released on his behalf by UK-based spokesman Ian Monk.
""David shared its full contents with two senior figures at GFH in Bahrain who are thus aware of what it contains,"" Mr Monk added.
Mr Haigh is accused of profiting from falsified invoices worth about Â£3m while at GFH Capital and prosecutors are investigating whether to press criminal charges.
Mr Haigh returned to Dubai last month believing he was about to discuss a job offer with his former employer - only to be handed over to the police. He has now been detained, without charge, for more than a month.
Dubai law states that if someone is suspected of cheating, a breach of trust or fraud they can be detained for as long as necessary, based on the complexities of the investigation.
In his interview with the BBC, Mr Haigh was softly spoken but appeared extremely anxious.
He said he felt ""trapped"", not by the UAE's legal system - with which he has no complaints - but by the lack of resources in the cell.
The former managing director is one of about 40 detainees, all of whom are denied access to pens and have to share a single payphone.
Mr Haigh said he was allowed very little time with his legal team in order to mount a defence and was particularly exasperated about his bail of about Â£3.5m - an amount he said he did not have.
GFH Capital said it had no control over the criminal investigation being carried out by the Dubai authorities.
Mr Haigh told the BBC he underwent stomach surgery in the UK before flying to Dubai and remains in lots of pain and unable to eat solid foods.
One of his teeth is also causing him pain and he says he has to take medication to sleep.
He continues to deny all of the charges but told the BBC he regretted ""signing blank cheques"" and allowing others to act on his behalf, prompted by his hectic travel schedule while working at GFH Capital.
GFH Capital has previously categorically denied that it, or its lawyers, have behaved in any way inappropriately.

"Child Soldiers International and ForcesWatch claim it costs the Ministry of Defence (MoD) twice as much to train a 16-year-old as it does an adult.

The calculations included £10,000 to recruit each person, irrespective of age. The other costs covered training, accommodation, meals, welfare, health, salary and other support per Army recruit in 2010-11.
Army personnel can be deployed once they turn 18 - which the two groups said meant that ""at any one time, approximately 150 soldiers are fully trained but too young to be deployed.""
They added that it costs approximately £2.65m to pay the salaries of these un-soldiers, which it said were each paid a salary of £17,690.
The report said the drop-out rate for minors was 36.6% compared with 28.3% for adults, the report said.
But it added that under-18s who completed their training were likely to serve for an average of 10 years, compared with seven-and-a-half years for adult recruits.
The report suggested taxpayers would save between £81.5m and £94m if all recruits were aged 18 and over.
Its authors also say the UK is becoming ""increasingly isolated"" internationally in continuing with the practice - no other country in Europe recruits from such a young age - and are calling on the MoD to raise the Army recruitment age to 18.
David Gee, of ForcesWatch, said recruiting under-18s into the Army was ""a practice from a bygone era"".
""It's not just young recruits who pay the price for outdated MoD policies - taxpayers do too,"" he said.
""And so does the Army when it finds itself undermanned on the front line because so many minors have dropped out of training.""
An MoD spokesman said it continued ""to actively recruit across all age groups"".
""As part of our duty of care to our recruits, no young person under the age of 18 years may join our armed forces without the formal written consent of their parent or guardian,"" he added.
""There are currently no plans to revisit the government's recruitment policy for under-18s, which is fully compliant with United Nations conventions.""
One former serviceman said that joining the armed forces as a teenager was ""a good thing for young people"".
Jason Hardick, from Maidenhead, Berkshire, told the BBC: ""It gives you self-confidence, self-discipline and a certain self-determination.  You never want to fail, you always want to move forward.""
He joined two weeks after his 16th birthday, and stayed for 10 years, only leaving to get married.
""I had a brilliant time, it's a good thing for young people to do and I was the youngest of my intake.""","The ""outdated"" practice of recruiting 16-year-olds into the Army is wasting up to £94m a year and should stop, two human rights groups have said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"The chairman of the Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) inquiry made the announcement during a preliminary hearing at Stormont, outlining its work.
Sir Patrick Coghlin said his inquiry will investigate failings in the scheme ""wherever accountability may lie"".
No time limit has been placed on the scheme to produce a conclusion, the retired Court of Appeal judge added.
He said he ""will insist"" that the inquiry has ""complete independence"" and it will carry out its work ""without fear or favour and free from any external pressures"".
The public and the media must understand that the inquiry is a ""fact-finding exercise"" and not an ""adversarial trial"", Sir Patrick said.
Statutory notices requiring production of documents have already been served on 125 bodies such as government departments.
Notices requiring witnesses statements have also been served.
The inquiry team expects to view hundreds of thousands of pages of documentation relating to the scheme.
Sir Patrick said another public session could be held in June, when further information about the inquiry timetable may be announced.
The green scheme was set up in 2012 to encourage businesses and other non-domestic users to move from using fossil fuels to renewable heating systems.
In what has been dubbed the ""cash-for-ash"" scandal, the flawed scheme meant users could legitimately earn more cash the more fuel they burned.
The inquiry was announced in January by the then finance minister Máirtín Ó Muilleoir.
It was set up to investigate the design and operation of the scheme, which at one point had a projected overspend of £490m.
Cost controls have now been introduced for the current financial year.
The inquiry will consider the delay in implementing cost controls in 2015 and allegations of political pressure to keep the scheme open at a time when applications were flooding in and the projected costs were spiralling.
The fallout was cited as one of the reasons for Sinn Féin withdrawing from devolved government and forcing the recent Northern Ireland Assembly election.
The party has said it will not share power with Arlene Foster as Democratic Unionist Party leader until the inquiry has fully investigated her role.
Mrs Foster was the minister in charge of the former Department of Enterprise Trade and Investment, which ran the scheme.
She has said she expects to be vindicated.
Meanwhile, some recipients of the RHI subsidy have said cuts to tariff rates have had a significant impact on their business.
The changes were applied from April, but a usage cap means some people who borrowed tens of thousands of pounds to put in a boiler are receiving no subsidy payments and are struggling to repay the banks.
A group of about 500 boiler owners is going to court in an attempt to have the new reduced tariffs set aside.

"Officers are searching a residential address in north-west London where they say a 60-year-old man was detained.
Mr Hussain has lived in the UK since 1991, saying his life would be at risk if he returned to Pakistan.
His party, which controls Karachi, has urged supporters to stay calm amid outbreaks of violence there.
The British and Pakistani authorities have in the past expressed concerns that any arrest of Altaf Hussain could lead to violent protests in Karachi.
Shootings have been reported from some parts of Pakistan's largest city, which BBC correspondents say is tense.
Traffic jams were reported in Karachi and other cities in Sindh province as businesses closed and people headed home fearing violence.
One man in the city, who gave his name as Tahir, told the BBC that MQM supporters were firing guns in the streets and setting fire to any shops which remained open.
Another, Nabil, said there had been ""turmoil"" and ""massive confusion"" about whether Altaf Hussain had been arrested or not.
Karachi in fear after Altaf Hussain arrest
Pakistan's powerful but absent politician
Karachi has been wracked by violence - much of it politically motivated.
Security is being tightened around the British mission in the city, which has been closed temporarily, and other buildings.
A Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) spokesman in London, Nadeem Nusrat, confirmed the arrest and urged its supporters to ""maintain peace at all costs"".
""The police arrived with a search warrant and wanted to question Mr Hussain regarding allegations of money laundering,"" he said in a statement.
Mr Hussain had been ""very unwell"" for the past few days and was getting ready to go to hospital when the police arrived, the statement added.
Police later confimed that Mr Hussain had been escorted to a hospital appointment while still in custody.
For many years now, Altaf Hussain's MQM has had a bloc of about 20 members in the National Assembly, making him a powerful figure both in Pakistan's biggest city Karachi and in the country as a whole. Remarkably he has led the party from London for over 20 years for fear that going back home could result in legal cases or a physical threat to his security.
As well as his solid electoral base in Karachi, Mr Hussain has a powerful party organisation in the city which is often accused of extorting money from businesses and using violence - or the threat of it - to get its way.
For years the British authorities tolerated the MQM being based in London. In fact British diplomats sought to take advantage of the situation by trying to influence the party to help achieve British objectives in Pakistan. But the mood changed when a senior MQM party member Imran Farooq was murdered in London in 2010.
Mr Hussain, his party, and some of his associates and relatives are currently the subject of a number of British investigations.
One is looking into the question of whether in his televised speeches he has incited violence in Pakistan, charges Mr Hussain denies. Another is into whether the MQM has paid its UK taxes correctly.
The most high-profile investigation followed the 2010 murder in London of a senior MQM leader Imran Farooq. No-one has been formally charged with his killing.
The MQM is often accused of extorting money from businesses in Karachi and shipping the money to the UK, charges the party also denies.","Police in London have arrested the leader of Pakistan's powerful MQM party, Altaf Hussain, on suspicion of money-laundering.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The skeleton belongs to a small, plant-eating dinosaur which lived 200 million years ago - at the beginning of the Jurassic Period.
Although this species was widespread at the time, scientists have largely had to rely on incomplete fossils.
The analysis was carried out at the ESRF facility in Grenoble, France, and showed that the specimen was juvenile.
The skeleton is too small and fragile, and the rocks around it too hard, to allow it to be studied by conventional means.
In addition, the rock matrix in which the fossil is preserved contains trapped minerals which prevented it from being scanned in a standard CT scanner.
The specimen was discovered in a stream bed on a farm in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa by palaeontologist Billy de Klerk.
""There's still a lot we don't know about early plant-eating dinosaurs,"" said Prof Jonah Choiniere from the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, South Africa.
""We need new specimens like this one and new technology like the synchrotron to fill in those gaps.""
Prof Choiniere, along with Dr Vincent Fernandez, from the ESRF (European Synchrotron), scanned the specimen with high-powered X-rays to understand how the species, Heterodontosaurus tucki, ate, moved, and breathed.
Scanning the fist-sized skull might allow the scientists to perform a 3D reconstruction of the animal's brain, offering insights into its lifestyle - including its sense of smell, and whether it was capable of complex behaviours.
The scientists think the diminutive dinosaur used its back teeth to grind down plant food. In other animals with similar anatomy, this requires the teeth to be replaced due to wear and tear.
The team members said they can now begin testing this theory and others regarding the dinosaur's biology and behaviour.

"He was in charge when the programme dropped an investigation into disgraced TV presenter and DJ Jimmy Savile.
Mr Rippon will help to build a public record of the corporation's television and radio journalism over 80 years.

""It is a significant challenge that requires an experienced leader and editor, and I'm delighted that Peter will be joining us to develop the BBC's Journal of Record,"" said Mr Conroy.
BBC Online and the BBC News website launched in 1997, leaving a permanent public daily record of the news output.
However, with more than 80 years of journalism, the aim is to make more of the BBC News archive available to the public.

The Journal of Record plans to publish a television and radio news bulletin from every day of the BBC's history, in the form of daily news broadcasts and scripts, together with the live coverage of key events.
Mr Rippon, who took the helm of Newsnight in 2008, takes up the new post in London on 25 February.
After the publication of a blog post in October 2012 explaining his editorial decision to drop the Savile investigation was found to have factual errors, Mr Rippon was asked to ""step aside"" while an inquiry was held.
His deputy Liz Gibbons was acting editor when Newsnight aired a story that led to former senior Conservative politician Lord McAlpine being falsely accused of sex crimes.
She also subsequently stepped aside and was told that she would be moved to another job, although the BBC has not yet confirmed in what capacity.

""If I'm walking around in my underwear and I'm drunk. Who else's fault can it be?"" Hynde told Krissi Murison.
In her recently completed autobiography, Reckless, Hynde recounts how she was forced to perform sexual acts on members of an Ohio motorcycle gang who had promised to take her to a party, but instead took her to an abandoned house.
""Technically speaking, however you want to look at it, this was all my doing and I take full responsibility,"" said the singer, who recalled being high on drugs at the time.
""If I'm walking around and I'm very modestly dressed and I'm keeping to myself and someone attacks me, then I'd say that's his fault. But if I'm being very lairy and putting it about and being provocative, then you are enticing someone who's already unhinged - don't do that. Come on! That's just common sense.""
""I don't think I am saying anything controversial, am I?"" she concluded.
Dismissive response
But her comments were condemned by the charity Victim Support who said that victims ""should not blame themselves"".
Lucy Hastings, director of Victim Support, said: ""Victims of sexual violence should never feel or be made to feel that they were responsible for the appalling crime they suffered - regardless of circumstances or factors which may have made them particularly vulnerable.
""They should not blame themselves or be blamed for failing to prevent an attack - often they will have been targeted by predatory offenders who are responsible for their actions.""
The response on Twitter was equally dismissive.

Analysis: James Gallagher, health editor, BBC news website
Is talc safe?
There have been concerns for years that using talcum powder, particularly on the genitals, may increase the risk of ovarian cancer.
But the evidence is not conclusive. The International Agency for Research on Cancer classifies talc used on the genitals as ""possibly carcinogenic"" because of the mixed evidence.
Why is there any debate?
The mineral talc in its natural form does contain asbestos and does cause cancer. However, asbestos-free talc has been used in baby powder and other cosmetics since the 1970s. But the studies on asbestos-free talc give contradictory results.
It has been linked to a cancer risk in some studies, but there are concerns that the research may be biased as the studies often rely on people remembering how much talc they used years ago. Other studies have argued there is no link at all and there is no link between talc in contraceptives such as diaphragms and condoms (which would be close to the ovaries) and cancer.
Also, there does not seem to be a ""dose-response"" for talc, unlike with known carcinogens like tobacco where the more you smoke, the greater the risk of lung cancer.
The charity Ovacome says there is no definitive evidence and that the worst-case scenario is that using talc increases the risk of cancer by a third.
But it adds: ""Ovarian cancer is a rare disease, and increasing a small risk by a third still gives a small risk. So even if talc does increase the risk slightly, very few women who use talc will ever get ovarian cancer.""
A J&J spokeswoman said the verdict contradicted 30 years of research supporting the safety of cosmetic talc.
Carol Goodrich said the company intends to appeal and will keep defending its products' safety.
The case follows another one in February, in which Johnson & Johnson was ordered to pay $72m to the family of a woman who claimed her death was linked to use of the company's Baby Powder talc.
Jackie Fox from Birmingham, Alabama died of ovarian cancer last year, aged 62, having used the talc for decades.
Her family argued that the firm knew of talc risks and failed to warn users.
J&J is appealing against that verdict, which sparked renewed interest in talc-powder lawsuits. Lawyers accuse J&J of failing to warn that talc was linked to an increased risk for ovarian cancer - a claim J&J denies. There are 1,200 other cases pending.
J&J shares were down 18 cents in after-hours trading to $112.57.",Pharmaceutical firm Johnson & Johnson (J&J) has been ordered to pay more than $55m (£40m) in compensation to an American  woman who says its talcum powder caused her ovarian cancer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"It also criticised those parties engaging in ""fear tactics"" at a time when it says the union is safe.
The party launched its assembly election manifesto on Tuesday.
Deputy leader Dr John Kyle said Stormont had become ""dysfunctional"".
He added: ""They are not tackling the real issues, the crisis in the health service, problems in the education system, housing waiting lists are increasing.
""A lot of those crucial social and economic issues are not being dealt with because of playing party politics and we have now retreated into a cultural war between the two largest parties.""
Dr Kyle, who is one of three PUP candidates standing in the election, also questioned the tactics being used by the DUP.
""To frighten people into feeling that if you don't vote in a certain way, then we will end up in a united Ireland is frankly dishonest,"" he said.
The manifesto - entitled Country Before Party - sets out the PUP's six commitments across health, education, the economy and housing.
They include reducing the suicide rate to zero through crisis intervention, ending the educational underachievement in working class areas, increase support for start up businesses and renewing town and city centres.
In his message, PUP leader Billy Hutchinson said the party was ""born out of a determination of loyalist leaders in Long Kesh to move away from the futility of conflict"".
He added Northern Ireland's ""journey has to be about facing the future and not the past"".
But the deputy leader said he was concerned smaller parties would suffer most in a shrinking Stormont.
""People think that to reduce the number of MLAs cuts the expense that's involved at Stormont, but the fewer MLAs the less the smaller groups are represented or heard, so that is detrimental to a healthy society, "" Dr Kyle said.","The Progressive Unionist Party has accused the DUP and Sinn Féin of engaging in a ""cultural war"" instead of dealing with ""crucial social economic issues"".",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Dawn McKenzie, 34, was stabbed by the 13-year-old in her home in Hamilton in 2011.
The inquiry into her death heard the boy had watched footage of his older siblings brandishing knives before he went to stay with the McKenzie family.
The same video showed them drinking alcohol with a gang's logo behind them.
Social worker Stephen Lorimer, giving evidence at the inquiry, said that the boy had been in a stable, happy placement with the foster couple who were caring for him.
But the couple handed in their notice after a member of their own family became very ill, and the boy was moved to stay with Mr and Mrs McKenzie instead.
Mr Lorimer, who is now a team leader within Glasgow City Council's social work department, told the inquiry that this had been a ""a terrible outcome"" for the boy, who stabbed Mrs McKenzie seven months later.
The boy was detained for seven years in 2012 after admitting culpable homicide on the grounds of diminished responsibility.
Mr Lorimer said both the boy and his two sisters had been ""extremely affected and damaged"" from their experiences before going into care.
The inquiry also heard that another boy threatened the teenager with a knife while he was staying with the foster couple prior to the McKenzies, and that the incident was reported to police.
Following this, the boy was not happy that his foster carers did not let him go outside to play. He was quoted at the inquiry as having said: ""Maybe the only way it will go away is if I deal with it myself. If I fight him and beat him he will back off.""
Mr Lorimer also told the inquiry about an incident where the boy punched a brick wall because he was not getting his own way.
But said he did not think the incident, that had taken place when the child was aged about 12, was very serious.

"""Indiscriminate use of force"" was used by the police in the run-up to the Olympic Games in August, according to one of the organisations.
In a report handed to the IOC, Terre des Hommes details a 103% increase in police killings compared to 2015.
The IOC is considering recommendations made in the report.
The Rio Games saw 85,000 police staff employed around the city - double the number used at London 2012 - and it led to 90% of tourists rating security as ""good"" or ""excellent"".
However, the report - Breaking Records - found evidence of a process of ""cleaning"" the streets of homeless children, as well as numerous effects resulting from the eviction of 22,000 families between 2009 and 2015 to clear space for the Games.
""Our research reveals human rights violations of youth and children in Rio, ranging from police killings, harsh police repression of protests and an alarming increase of police violence against adolescents in street situation,"" said Andrea Florence, author of the report.
Renata Neder of Amnesty International Brazil said: ""The Olympics were a missed opportunity for public security in Rio de Janeiro.
""We documented a number of violations by security forces, especially a significant increase in the number of people killed by the police and a violent repression of protests.""
Specific findings in the report include:
Terre des Hommes called on the IOC to implement measures for future Olympic Games, such as including obligations to comply with international children's rights standards in the host city contract for 2024.
It wants the IOC to communicate with the Rio 2016 local organising committee and Brazilian authorities to ensure they have taken ""all appropriate measures related to violations of child rights"".
This includes ensuring victims have access to legal advice and that ""individual cases are duly investigated, with access to remedy and compensation"".
""We call upon the IOC to put in place all measures necessary to avoid repeating the same pattern of violations we have seen in Rio,"" said Florence.
""Only then will the Games will have a chance to create a better world for generations to come.""
The IOC cited a ""number of instances"" relating to the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi, Russia, where allegations were followed up with the local authorities.
An IOC statement to BBC Sport added: ""Where cases are identified - and clearly related to the staging of the Olympic Games - the IOC has a long-standing commitment to follow-up on those issues.

"Smokers will be prescribed with nicotine replacement patches to help them cope during their stay at affected hospital sites, but e-cigarettes will not be allowed.
Staff were already banned from smoking within the grounds but there were smoking shelters for patients.
The changes, adopted by other Welsh boards, was approved on Tuesday.
Ahead of the meeting, Dr Sharon Hopkins, public health director of Cardiff and Vale University Health Board, said the proposals had been 18 months in the planning because officials recognised a ban would ""not be easy and patients and the public would have to be supported"".
She added: ""We recognise that this has potential issues and have taken actions to address this.
""There is no point us saying that you can't smoke on our sites full stop - we have to make sure that we are able to support people with their addiction.""
Dr Hopkins said patients in hospital currently receive support to cope with any existing addictions and the same help would be offered to smokers.
She said they would be given support from the health board's smoking cessation service and smokers could be prescribed with nicotine replacement patches to help them cope during their stay.
""We know from evidence elsewhere that a total ban is much more likely to decrease the number of cigarettes people smoke and that they are much more likely to try and quit,"" she said.

Police officers opened fire to try to stop the mob, wounding several people.
Tensions in the country are high following the government's decision to ban India's Daughter, a film about the 2012 gang rape of a student.
The Hindustan Times newspaper reports that the crowd ""tore down two gates and took custody"" of the suspect, before dragging him to the town's landmark clock tower.
Police say the man was a Bengali-speaking Muslim trader from neighbouring Assam state. He was arrested in February on charges of rape.

"Andrew Wright flew 268kg (591lbs) of the drug from Germany to the UK in eight trips in his light aircraft.
He used his firm, Skyviews R Us Ltd, as a cover for the operation described as ""off the scale"" by the judge.
Wright, of Toad Hall, Selby, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to import cocaine at the Old Bailey.
The court heard Wright would collect the drugs, which had been bought in Amsterdam by gang member Jamie Williams, from Kassel airport in Hesse, Germany, before flying back to Breighton Airfield in Selby, North Yorkshire.
Having returned to the UK, Williams, 38, would collect the drugs from Wright and deliver them to gang leader, Mark Dowling, 43, in Essex.
The gang used several literary references aside from W E Johns fictional pilot Biggles, including Ginger - his companion - and Skippy
Border control officers smashed the racket in November 2014 when they found four bricks of cocaine in the boot of Wright's Porsche Cayenne and a further 30 hidden in the tail section of his plane.
Wright was paid £1,500 per kilo he imported while ""trusted lieutenant"" Williams was paid £12,000 plus expenses for his involvement.
Wright's barrister, Tom Gent, said his client became involved in the operation following the death of his wife's son in 2013.
""He lost focus on his business. For many years he and his wife had run a legitimate business in aerial photography. He took his eye off the ball and ran into financial difficulties.""
Dowling, of Surman Crescent, in Brentwood, Essex, was jailed for 24 years. Williams, of Romford, Havering, received a 23-year jail term.
Both men had pleaded guilty to their part in the drug smuggling plot between 1 September and 18 November, 2014.
Williams also admitted separate drugs, firearms and money laundering offences.

"Over the last three years, Zimbabwe's 89-year-old leader has become an unlikely fashion icon for the designer label House of Gushungo.
""This is the most valuable T-shirt I can wear,"" 28-year-old Liberty Mangwiro, resplendent in his black R G Mugabe top, tells me as he walks to his car in a smart business district of Harare.
""It represents the man who stands for what he believes in Africa.""
But the firm behind the label is now at the centre of a dispute with President Robert Mugabe's own party, Zanu-PF, as the country heads towards Saturday's referendum on a new constitution and elections expected in July.
The party wants to make money from what it sees as a profitable scheme and Justice Minister Patrick Chinamasa is trying to patent the R G Mugabe signature.
""It's an intellectual property which we have to maintain. We have allowed every Jack and Jill to do what they like about the whole thing,"" Zanu-PF spokesman Rugare Gumbo tells the BBC, while President Mugabe in a suit and tie looks down on him from a portrait on his office wall.
""The main reason why the brand is so popular is that he is a highly intellectual leader,"" he says.
""But we want to control it to make sure whoever is going to use it will have to pay something. So we are going to restrict it as a party,"" he says.
Sales have been slowly growing for Yedu Nesu, the company behind the House of Gushungo, though it is reluctant to discuss profits made so far.
T-shirts, costing between $10 (£6.50) and $15, umbrellas, berets and even sports clothes bearing the liberation leader's signature sold out at a stall in Gweru during the Zanu-PF conference in December.
Away from Zanu-PF events though, it is hard to find anywhere to buy the products as the company does not have an official outlet, although it says it is moving soon to a shop in central Harare.
Robert Mugabe: The survivor
Its most recent accessory is a cap with 1924 - the year of Mr Mugabe's birth - imprinted on it, which was released in time for the president's birthday celebrations last month.
Justin Matenda, Yedu Nesu's chief executive, says the Zanu-PF leader himself gave the blessing for the signature branding when asked - and has no shares in the venture.
""He was overwhelmed,"" said the 29-year-old businessman, who heads a three-man team.
They design and market the products and outsource the manufacturing.
""Yedu Nesu has the sole rights to market, distribute and manufacture the brand… the Robert Mugabe regalia,"" he said.
""The president does not want to make money,"" said Mr Matenda, explaining that the understanding was that once the fashion company began to make a profit, some of it would go a humanitarian cause.
Zanu-PF may see the label as a way to woo urban young trendy voters as it traditionally garners most of its support in rural areas.
Metropolitan hubs are the heartlands for the Movement for Democratic Change, whose leader Morgan Tsvangirai is set to challenge Mr Mugabe once more in this year's presidential election.
Appealing to voters born after independence in 1980, when Mr Mugabe came to power, and who did not experience life under white-minority rule, is a challenge for Zanu-PF.
At the moment it is mainly middle-aged people who can be spotted in Harare sporting the R G Mugabe clothes line.
Mr Tsvangirai's spokesman Luke Tamborinyoka told the BBC that: ""The Mugabe fashion craze is a desperate attempt by his brand managers to catch the young voters.
""It's an attempt to seduce the young, first-time voters who are believed to be almost a million - a very big number considering Zimbabwe's voting population.""
But he said he did not think the designer clothes would make any difference to the way people vote.
""No amount of fashion labels will save him in the next election.""
Youth appeal is also the goal for House of Gushungo.
Saint Mahaka, the label's designer, gives an insight into their strategy.
""The young guys are into fashion. They talk about label, label, label... he [Mugabe] is already a brand himself.
""We decided, there is Versace, there is Polo, there is Tommy Hilfiger, people are putting on these labels, but don't know who they are and what the story is.
""We know President Mugabe's story, we know who he is.
""And those who resonate with his story and what he stands for - there is something only for the older guys but for the young guys as well.""
Moses Donsa-Nkomo, who teaches intellectual property law at the University of Zimbabwe, says Yedu Nesu may risk a political backlash if it attempts to register the brand without permission from Zanu-PF.
The House of Gushungo team says their business is driven by a desire to ensure Mr Mugabe's legacy, not by avarice.
While many people accuse Mr Mugabe of wrecking what was once one of Africa's most diversified economies, his supporters argue that he is standing up for the rights of black Zimbabweans against the powers of colonialism - and the designer clothes are part of that battle.
""We all came from families that went through the liberation struggle,"" says Mr Matenda.
""Our upbringing has been mentored by the concept and principles of empowerment and upholding the ideals of black Zimbabweans,"" he said.
""We are just there to propel his identity, to maintain his legacy.""",People with the signature R G Mugabe emblazoned over their fronts or atop a stylish beret can be seen proudly walking around Zimbabwe's capital - a city that is usually a hotbed of anti-Mugabe feeling.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Having banked the biggest cheque of his career as Scottish open runner-up, a tie for fifth at the Open at Royal Troon earned him a further £235,557.
He now heads for Springfield, New Jersey for the US PGA in 10 days' time.
Hatton admits he still needs to work on keeping a cool head, saying: ""It's something I needed to get better at and I'm slowly getting there.""
His finish at Troon was the best by an Englishman at the Open since Ian Poulter and Lee Westwood tied for third behind Phil Mickelson at Muirfield three years ago.
He acknowledges, however, that his emotions can still get the better of him on the course.
""The fire is still burning inside and I'll show that from time to time,"" said 24-year-old Hatton, from Marlow, who plays at Harleyford.
""I try my best not to, but I'm only human, and I'm going to make mistakes every now and then.
""I'm so passionate about wanting to do well, and sometimes that just overspills.""

""We make a good team. He's helped me a lot.""

""I can't wait,"" Hatton told BBC Sport. ""I really enjoyed my time at Whistling Straits. I'm going to enjoy a week off to get ready for a return to the States.
""I got a lot of confidence from last week and I took it into the Open and it's great that I now don't have to try and qualify again (following his Top 10 finish) for Royal Birkdale next year.""
Hatton's surge in form also means he is now within reach of a Ryder Cup place, but after the USPGA his main interest is the holiday he has planned afterwards in New York with his girlfriend.

Corette, of Manor Avenue, Brockley, south London, was given a hospital order and restriction order with no time limit to protect the public.
The Old Bailey heard he was diagnosed with a depressive condition and Asperger's syndrome in 2010.
The court was told the supermarket shelf-stacker was sectioned in March 2015 and admitted to Ladywell Unit located at Lewisham Hospital.
The specialist unit for patients with mental health disorders is managed by South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust.
In July his condition and behaviour was judged to have become more stable and he was allowed to go unescorted to his mother's home in Lochaber Road on day release.
Later that day he refused to return to hospital and said he feared his life was in danger.
The court heard he picked up a champagne bottle and hit his sister, saying he ""had to do it"".
He then went downstairs and attacked his mother, who was frightened of him and had padlocked some of the rooms.
A post-mortem examination found she died of head injuries.
Judge Wide said he was satisfied the defendant was suffering from a mental disorder.

The Mail printed an apology and paid substantial damages to Rowling in May 2014, but challenged Rowling's right to give a court statement about the case.
Last week the Court of Appeal dismissed the newspaper's objections.
It paved the way for Thursday's unilateral statement, which was read out by solicitor Keith Schilling on behalf of Rowling, as part of the libel settlement.
During her successful libel case, the author said the newspaper's story was ""premised on a false picture"" of an article she had written 10 days earlier for single parents' charity Gingerbread.

"Thousands of commercial vessels from around the world enter UK waters every year, bringing a chance for international criminal gangs to surreptitiously move drugs over water and on to shore.
If illegal substances are being smuggled, it is the job of the National Deep Rummage Team (NDRT) to find where.
But vessels are vast structures with many hiding places - some are capable of carrying 14,000 containers, equal in length to a 44-mile long train.
Drugs could be concealed anywhere from under a cabin bed bunk to the harder to reach places like tanks filled with liquid or buried deep within the bulkhead.
Paul Tunney, the team's senior officer, said: ""It's like a giant game of hide and seek but there's no-one to tell us if we're getting warmer.
""You've got to go on board with imagination and with the mindset that you are going to find something.""
Working vessels are hostile environments and with it brings the risk of danger to rummagers.
They have to climb in and inspect tanks, crawl into the vessel's inner structure or scale the hull walls of the cargo holds.
Because of the specialised nature of their work, they also have to be trained in immediate life support first aid and self rescue, rather than rely on other emergency services.
""When we're on a vessel it is working, it is discharging and loading cargo so there are lots of things on the move,"" said Mr Tunney.
""If we're going into a confined space it needs to be aerated, there could be gases or a lack of oxygen in it.
""If we're going into a tank, we have to check the atmosphere of the tank and go in wearing breathing apparatus.
""People have died in accidents on vessels and we don't want that to happen to our officers.""
As crucial as hunting out and searching the confined spaces is, the 'bread and butter' of rummage work is talking to those on board.
""We talk to the captain and crew, monitor their body language, see how they feel about us being on board and take all those factors into account,"" said Mr Tunney.
""There are clues, it's just recognising them. It may be that the captain says no-one has been in a particular area but you notice footprints or you see some new piece of construction.
""Vessels don't smuggle, it's people that smuggle.""
The Border Force's NDRT formed in 2004. There are now four specialist teams based at Liverpool, Immingham, Felixstowe and Southampton.
Since its launch, the teams have found some 777 kilos of class A drugs with a street value of approximately Â£155m.
The teams are responding to an ever-changing shipping world.
Crew previously made their fortunes smuggling tea, silk and brandy into UK ports.
Now highly organised international crime groups are able to bring drugs, cigarettes and illegal immigrants into the UK.
Mr Tunney said: ""Often we find people involved in smuggling are going on diving holidays thinking they can learn to dive and then collect drugs attached to the hull of vessels over here.
""Diving in water near ships is totally different to swimming in the Red Sea.
""It's an unforgiving environment and people can very quickly get disorientated.""
The team works closely with other maritime authorities, the police dive teams, the Serious Organised Crime Agency and other government departments.
Vessels are selected for searching by an intelligence-driven method, with those presenting the highest risk targeted.
Much of the team's success comes down to having access to the MV Altea - a ship that was impounded after being caught attempting to smuggle 17 tonnes of cannabis into the country in 1989.
It was agreed by the Treasury to let the rummaging team use it as their training facility and the vessel is now permanently moored in Liverpool Docks.

"The Coventry-born fly-half scored 33 points, bagging a try and kicking eight penalties and two conversions in a terrific performance.
Joe Simpson, Elliot Daly and Andrea Masi also scored second-half tries.
But Goode was man of the match - in front of a record Premiership crowd of 28,254 at a recognised home ground.
Apart from matches held at Wembley and Twickenham, no game in the two decades of Premiership rugby has been watched by more people - and, whether old or new Wasps fans, there was plenty to warm the soul on a cold winter's day in Coventry.
It was actually Wasps' third game at the ground, having played a Heineken Cup semi-final at the Ricoh in April 2007 and a group game in the same competition against Munster seven months later.
Goode, the former England stand-off, had the honour of claiming Wasps' first points at the Ricoh as landlords when he booted the hosts ahead after just six minutes from 45 metres, and he added five more penalties before the break.
His dominance was interrupted only briefly by Irish prop Geoff Cross becoming the first player to score a try, when he cashed in on sloppy defence to burst over from 15 metres out.
Shane Geraghty converted that, while Tom Homer added three penalties to keep the visitors' arrears to 18-16 at the break - but it was pretty much one-way traffic in the second half.
Four minutes into the second half Wasps scrum-half Simpson, on a right-wing overlap, ran in his side's opening try from the 22, with Goode failing for once with the conversion.
But he quickly found his range again with his seventh penalty before adding his eighth as further punishment following the incident which saw Irish hooker David Paice sent to the sin bin.
Goode then helped cash in on their extra man advantage when he went in under the posts, converting his own try for a 36-16 lead.
Daly ran in on the left for try number three but it was not until the final minute that Wasps claimed their bonus point when Italy international Masi went over in the left corner.
Wasps stand-off Andy Goode told BBC Sport:
""It sounds a bit cheesy, but that really is the stuff dreams are made of.
""Obviously as a Sky Blues fan I've been up here to watch Coventry City play a few times, so it was great for me to run out and play here.
""And to then come off and find out that it was an individual Premiership points record is Christmas come early for me.
""I said to the lads before the game 'let's not get carried away by the emotion of it'. And, although the first half was pretty turgid, we've got the job done in the end.""
Wasps captain James Haskell told BBC Sport:
""It was a great way to start here. We've finished one chapter and started a new one.
""It took us 55 minutes to really get going, but we were disciplined and controlled. We just hope we've done enough to make people want to come back here and watch us again.""
London Irish coach Brian Smith:
""We knew what to expect and we made a decent fist of it, but we're disappointed with the blow-out at the back end.
""I don't want to take anything away from Wasps, as this was their day, but we have a frustrated group of players in the dressing room.
""When a young ref gets a crack in front of a big crowd, you are concerned. The penalty count was 10-2 at half-time and you have to hope it levels out, but it didn't. But you just have to wear it and move on.
""You have to applaud Wasps for their enterprise in making this move up here to Coventry and good luck to them.""

"President Barrow's plane touched down at Banjul airport where jubilant crowds waited to welcome him.
Mr Barrow, who has been in neighbouring Senegal, won elections in December.
However a handover was stalled when Mr Jammeh, Gambia's president of 22 years, refused to step aside.
He left for exile at the weekend after mediation by regional leaders and the threat of military intervention.
Mr Barrow, dressed in white robes and a cap, stepped off the plane in Banjul as heavily armed troops from Senegal and Nigeria stood by.
Overhead, a fighter jet from the West African force guaranteeing the new president's security performed fly-pasts.
""I am a happy man today,"" Mr Barrow told a reporter from the Associated Press in the crush at the airport, adding: ""I think the bad part is finished now.""
The president said his priority was to appoint his cabinet and ""then get the ball rolling"".
The BBC's Umaru Fofana in Banjul said that thousands of people had tried to force their way into the airport to see Mr Barrow return and they burst into celebration as soon as his plane touched down.
President Barrow was driven from the airport in a convoy of cars and waved to the crowds who lined the route.
Supporter Ibrahima Gaye said Mr Barrow would be different from Mr Jammeh ""in all aspects"".
""We have been living under dictatorship for 22 years. You can go home at night and sleep without worrying you will be arrested before daybreak,"" he said.
President Barrow is staying at his own home while a security assessment is carried out at the official residence, State House.
Mr Barrow was sworn in as president at the Gambian embassy in Senegal a week ago, but a public inauguration on home soil is planned soon, aides say.
The UN envoy for West Africa, Mohamed ibn Chambas, has said the UN will help guarantee security in The Gambia.
Several thousand West African soldiers remain in The Gambia amid reports that rogue pro-Jammeh elements are embedded in the country's security forces.
The West African force had threatened to drive Mr Jammeh from office if he did not agree to go.
The new president has asked for the force to remain in The Gambia for six months.
His spokesman Halifa Sallah said an inauguration was being planned for the national stadium in Banjul. ""It will be an occasion to show strength. Everyone will be invited. The president will address his people,'' he told Senegalese radio.
Mr Jammeh, who was a 29-year-old army lieutenant when he came to power in a 1994 coup, had refused to accept the results of the December election.
After his departure, reports emerged that more than $11m (Â£8.8m) had disappeared from The Gambia's state coffers.
However a presidential adviser said the police had been asked to investigate and would determine if anything was missing.
Mr Jammeh has not commented on the allegations.
In other developments, parliament has cancelled the state of emergency declared by Mr Jammeh last week. It also revoked legislation that would have extended its life for a further 90 days.",Gambia's President Adama Barrow has returned to the country to assume power - days after his predecessor Yahya Jammeh left to go into exile.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ellis Genge crossed to extend Tigers' advantage after the break and Freddie Burns' boot put them 15 points ahead.
But Bristol hit back and Rob Hawkins' score helped them earn a fourth losing bonus point of the season so far.
England centre Manu Tuilagi made his return for Leicester off the bench after two months out with a groin injury and helped his side move within a point of third-placed Wasps.
Tigers' first-half try came when Bristol had 14 men after lock Ian Evans was sin-binned and Thompstone gathered Burns' fine cross-field ball to take advantage.
The hosts also saw Jason Woodward shown a yellow card after the break, before they battled back after Tigers went down to 14 themselves as Lachlan McCaffrey was penalised for a defensive infringement.
Bristol, who released centre Gareth Maule by mutual consent earlier on Friday, sensed they could grab a dramatic victory when Adrian Jarvis kicked them to within five points, but Leicester's defence held firm.

"It estimates poor diets are causing around 70,000 premature deaths each year.
In a major report on unhealthy diets, the body called for the extra money raised to be used to subsidise fresh fruit and vegetables.
The Food and Drink Federation said the measure would not change diets.
There has been growing concern about the damaging impact of sugar on health - from the state of people's teeth to type 2 diabetes and obesity.
In its Food for Thought report, the BMA warns that a 330ml can of pop is likely to contain up to nine teaspoons of sugar that are simply ""empty calories"".
The report said taxing specific food groups - such as the sugar drinks tax introduced in Mexico - were shown to cut consumption.
Doctors said a tax of at least 20% would be needed to deter customers.  It would mean a 65p can of fizzy drink would cost at least 78p and a two-litre bottle would shoot up from Â£1.85 to Â£2.22.
The report says the extra revenue should be used to make fruit and vegetables cheaper so that we ""create an environment where dietary choices default to healthy options"".
Dr Shree Datta, from the British Medical Association, told the BBC: ""I think it is a massive problem illustrated by the fact obesity is creeping up.
""We're looking at 30% of the UK population being obese by the year 2030, a large extent of that is due to the amount of sugar we're actually consuming without realising.
""The biggest problem is a lot of us are unaware of the amount of sugar we are consuming on a day-to-day basis.""
The government's main approach to obesity has to been to work with the food industry to get it to voluntarily reduce calorie content.
A spokeswoman said obesity was of ""great concern to this government"".
She added: ""There is no silver bullet but we do want to see industry go further to cut the amount of sugar in food and drinks so that people can make healthier choices.""
The BMA's report is timely. Later this week, the UK's official Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition will publish its final advice on the amount of sugar we should be eating.
Its draft report said sugar added to food or naturally present in fruit juice and honey should account for 5% of energy intake.
The current recommended level is 10% and many people fail to meet that.
Ian Wright, director-general of the Food and Drink Federation, said: ""We share the BMA's concerns about the health of young people in the UK.""
However, it said many foods were already taxed at 20% through VAT such as soft drinks and confectionery.
He added: ""Where additional taxes have been introduced they've not proven effective at driving long-term, lasting change to diets.
""In recent years, calories in household foods and drinks have been gradually lowered through recipe reformulations, including sugar reductions, and changes to portion sizes.""","An extra 20% tax on sugary drinks should be introduced to tackle the obesity crisis, the British Medical Association says.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Next season, with their ground sold for redevelopment, they will play their football 13 miles up the A449 at Aggborough, home of local rivals Kidderminster Harriers.
And, although at the moment, their hopes for the future are no more than pipedreams, the long-term plan is to one day return to the city.
City will leave behind a lot of memories for their fans, most notably their finest hour when, on 15 January 1959, they knocked Liverpool out of the FA Cup in a third-round tie in front of a crowd of 15,000.
The local folklore is that it was the defeat which cost Liverpool manager Phil Taylor his job and led to the appointment of the legendary Bill Shankly, triggering the start of the famous 'Boot Room' dynasty at Anfield.
The reality is that actually happened 11 months later - and Liverpool were only a Division Two club at the time, but they do say, 'never let the facts get in the way of a good story'.
There are certainly plenty of tales told about that famous day, which, for all Kidderminster's later FA Cup-fighting exploits, still ranks as the biggest in Worcestershire's football history.
Among those crowding into the stadium that day was schoolboy Peter King, who was destined to play for Worcester and later, at the highest level, for Cardiff City.
King is now 70 and living in Spain, but he will never forget that cold winter afternoon at St George's Lane.
""City beat Liverpool,"" he told BBC Hereford & Worcester. ""It sounds rather strange nowadays, doesn't it?
""Liverpool were in the second division in those days, but nevertheless it was a fantastic victory.
""The game couldn't be played on the Saturday as the pitch was waterlogged as per usual, so they played in the midweek and we all had time off school to go to watch it.
""I can remember being there with some of my schoolmates and we thought it was an unbelievable day for Worcester City.""
The teenage King was already starting to attract attention from Football League clubs - Bolton Wanderers and Brentford were among those keeping a watchful eye on him - but it was Cardiff who made the first move.
""Although St George's Lane is soon to be lost forever, maybe a new spirit for this great club is about to be found.
""After the final whistle blows on Saturday I will leave with a lump in my throat, but also with hope in my heart that the fans will continue to support the club through their Aggborough exile and work together to bring them back to the city of Worcester soon.
""As a lifelong City fan who grew up in the shadow of St George's Lane, spending the last few years commentating on every match for BBC Hereford & Worcester has been a pleasure and a privilege.
""My first memories of 'The Lane' are peeping through holes in the fence alongside the canal towpath to glimpse the action underneath the floodlights before climbing over at the side of the Shed to get a proper view of my early City heroes like Micky Tuohy, Paul Moss and John McGrath playing in the Alliance Premier League.
""I started my stint as City commentator during Andy Preece's tenure, although sadly not in time to cover the televised FA Cup tie against Huddersfield in 2005.
""This has always been my favourite ground to commentate from and the wooden hut at the back of the main stand has become almost my second home over the past few years.""
Dan Johnson, home and away commentator on City games for BBC Hereford & Worcester
Cardiff were by then managed by former Worcester boss Bill Jones, who had masterminded that win over Liverpool and still had strong connections with the club.
As a youngster, King was very green when it came to salary negotiations, so he sought advice from one of the senior players at Worcester, Sammy Bryceland.
""We got on really well and he said to me: 'Whatever they offer you, say no because there is more - they are bound to offer you more'.
""Part of the deal involved Harry Knowles, who had been in that City side that had beaten Liverpool.
""When Bill Jones had gone down to Cardiff he had taken Harry Knowles with him, but Harry was in his twenties by then and maybe it was a bit late for him to make the grade.
""Harry was looking to come back to City and I was going to be the makeweight.
""Bill Jones showed me around Ninian Park and then said: 'We'll offer you £12 10 shillings per week', but I remembered what Sammy Bryceland had said so, much to Bill Jones' surprise, I told him: 'Can I think about it?'
""Harry was there and he asked me 'Is it all sorted out?'. I told him I was still undecided, but I knew what I wanted to do so I went back in again and told Bill Jones I was going to sign.
""Bill later told me that, if I had asked for more, we wouldn't have done the deal because there was another 17-year-old in the first team on £12 10 shillings.
""I'm glad I ignored Sammy's advice, or I might never have had 13 seasons at Cardiff City.""
Like all who have played for, watched and reported on Worcester City, however, it is St George's Lane that will be uppermost in their thoughts this weekend.

"Its fossils indicate that the normal-sized primitive humans who first set foot on the Indonesian island of Flores shrank ""rapidly"" to become Hobbit-sized.
The remains are of at least one adult and two children, who are all just as small as their descendents.
A paper in the journal Nature details the latest findings.
The Hobbit's discovery in a cave on Flores created a sensation 12 years ago. Just a metre in height (hence the affectionate nickname), it was initially thought they could have been living as recently as 12,000 years ago.
Subsequent analysis has shown they actually existed slightly further back in time, between 50,000 and 60,000 years ago - not that this lessened the fascination with the diminutive species more properly called Homo floresiensis.
And now comes new research from some of the scientists involved in the original discovery that reveals insights on the Hobbit's lineage.
The team presents much older fossils, dating back 700,000 years, unearthed at a site named Mata Menge.
These remains consist of a piece of lower jawbone and several teeth. They are remarkably similar to those of the Hobbit find in 2004 and are thought to belong to the ancestors of floresiensis.
There are also stone tools at the same site which are much older still, suggesting ancient human-like creatures lived on Flores a million years ago. One theory is that these people were another normal-sized species we now refer to as Homo erectus, which was known to live on the island of Java, about 500 km west of Flores.
According to Dr Yousuke Kaifu, from Tokyo's National Museum of Nature and Science, the discovery of the tiny 700,000 year old hobbit ancestor suggests that erectus might have shrunk within the space of just 300,000 years, which is a remarkably short period in evolutionary terms.
""What is truly unexpected is that the size of the finds indicates that Homo floresiensis had already obtained its small size by at least 700,000 years ago.""
Dr Gert van den Bergh, from the University of Wollongong's Centre for Archaeological Science, who led the team, said the entire team was surprised at the small size of the adult jawbone.
""We were expecting to find something larger than what we found, something closer to the size of the original founder population,  Homo erectus, but it turns out that they were as small if not smaller than Homo floresiensis.
""The rapid evolution seems quite fast but we have no examples of human or primates (shrinking) on other islands to compare it to.""
The theory is that erectus shrank to cope with the Island's relatively meagre resources. But the big question is how did it get there. Homo erectus was too primitive to build boats and it was too far for the species to swim from Java to Flores. One possibility, is that individuals were swept across by a giant tidal wave, according to the researchers.
But Prof Chris Stringer of the Natural History Museum in London believes that the evidence for the rapid shrinking theory is circumstantial: ""We do not know how large the tool-makers at one million years actually were, since we do not have their fossils yet; and, secondly, we cannot be sure that the evidence at one million years actually represents the first arrival of humans on Flores.""
He added: ""It is just as likely that the ancestors of (The Hobbit) came from somewhere like Sulawesi, to the North, and we have no evidence so far of who might have been there more than a million years ago.""
The researchers acknowledge that their argument is based on scant data: one fragment of a jawbone and a handful of teeth. But Dr Adam Brum of Griffiths University in Australia says the team hopes to gather more fossils to build up a more complete picture.
""We want to know what the very, very first (humans) that set foot on the island were like. That involves finding the fossils that date back to before a million years ago and which go with the stone tools.""
Dr van den Bergh added that the discovery of Hobbit-like humans living on Flores 700,000 years ago ruled out the possibility that the discovery in 2004 was of a group of modern humans who had been stunted by illness.
""This find quashes once and for all any doubters that believe Homo floresiensis was merely a sick modern human.""

"The 34-year-old woman, from Bradford, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was stopped by the Turkish authorities last October.
She had flown to Istanbul with the intention of travelling to Raqqa.
At a previous hearing at Leeds Crown Court, she pleaded guilty to two counts of abducting children under 16.
Sentencing her at the same court, Judge Rodney Jameson QC said she was ""determined to take them to Raqqa in Syria"".
The court heard she wanted to live under strict Sharia law and believed such a regime could only be found where IS imposed control.
She had returned to the UK after her husband and parents contacted police.

"Threatened by deforestation and poaching to supply the black market trade in tiger body parts, it is one of the most endangered cats on the planet.
But over the past decade or so, a new threat has emerged - a silent, insidious one - canine distemper virus.
Worldwide there are an estimated 400-500 Siberian or Amur tigers.
Exact numbers are hard to determine because this is a reclusive animal that is rarely observed.
Yet, at the turn of the century, some of these otherwise withdrawn animals were seen wandering onto roads and into villages in the Russian Far East. They were fearless and docile, confused and dazed; the antithesis of their usual ferocious and wary demeanour.
Over the next few years evidence mounted that this, the largest living felid, was suffering from an infectious agent and the indications - the nature of the illness, historical understanding of wild cat infections and the diagnosis, in a single wild tiger, of a virus belonging to the morbillivirus genus - provided a likely culprit.
A study published in the journal mBio, confirmed these suspicions. Genetic analysis of several dead tiger samples showed that canine distemper virus was the cause.
Canine distemper virus (CDV), a relative of the human measles virus, was first described in dogs and infection causes fatal pneumonia and encephalitis (inflammation of the brain).
But this virus is incredibly promiscuous and can infect jump into a variety of different animals - usually with catastrophic effects.
Two suspected CDV outbreaks, the first in 1988 and a second in 2000, killed thousands of Baikal then Caspian seals.
The virus has also ripped through Africa, with fatal outbreaks in silver-backed jackals and bat-eared foxes and catastrophic die-offs in wild dog populations that continue to this day.
For years, cats were thought resistant to CDV. Yes, domestic cats could be infected in the laboratory, but this was inefficient and the virus was unable to pass from one animal to another.
A massive demise in 1994 of African lions living in the Serengeti national park in Tanzania showed that this was fallacy. This population of closely monitored lions succumbed to CDV. Whilst only 34 lion deaths were documented during the outbreak, this was only the tip of the iceberg.
Before CDV struck, the lion population numbered 3,000, but afterwards this had fallen by a third. In the same outbreak, countless hyenas, bat-eared foxes and leopards also perished.
Add to this the recent report of infection of large numbers of South American jaguar and it is evident that this virus has little, if any respect for the so-called species barrier - the unique inherent host factors and properties that prevent viruses from jumping from one species to another.
In an intriguing turn of events, CDV was also starting to spark fatal outbreaks in various primates.
So what should we make of the emergence of CDV infection in primates. Is this an indication of the potential for a more compelling species jump? Could CDV do the unthinkable and infect humans?
The simple answer is a resounding yes. At least, in theory it is.
To replicate, a virus has to get into a host cell.  It does this through interactions between proteins on its surface with proteins - receptors - on the surface of the cell. These receptors act as gateways into the cell and if the virus protein fits then infection takes place.
Different animals possess slightly different versions of these receptors on their cells so the virus proteins also have to change to be able to unlock them.
A single mutation in one of surface proteins in CDV present in primates is all it takes for the virus to successfully use the human receptor. This is a tiny species barrier.
But before banishing the pet dog to a high containment kennel then donning personal protective clothing before you go near, there's a key part of the story we need to consider - one that's probably been protecting us for all of these years.
When you're exposed to a virus your body recognises it as foreign and your blood cells generate antibodies which bind to the virus surface proteins and protect us from infection. It's the basis for vaccination.
Fortunately, the surface protein of the measles virus is so similar to CDV that antibodies generated by the measles vaccine also protect against CD; and other morbilliviruses too.
But, if we ever eradicate measles and stop vaccination, maybe then we will be susceptible to CDV.
But what of the Amur tiger - will CDV ensure its ultimate demise?
As Dr Denise McAloose, lead author on the mBio paper, explained: ""When you're talking about four to five hundred animals and your losing reproductive females and their offspring, the overall impact on populations is huge.
""Some of the earlier modelling work, if it were to pan out, does suggest that this is a significant disease even at the levels of disease we are detecting now, which is probably just the tip of the iceberg.""
A bleak outlook that is shared by a University of Nottingham colleague, veterinary virologist Dr Rachael Tarlinton: ""Because they are such tiny populations even relatively small mortality events can seriously harm their genetic diversity and this might just be enough to push them over the edge.""
Hopefully it's not too late. We know that CDV vaccines work and a targeted vaccination programme might just pull Amur tigers back from the brink.
Current CDV vaccines have to be injected - no trivial task when the animal you want to protect is so difficult to track down and so dangerous to handle.
But not all vaccines need to be injected - some very effective vaccines have been developed for oral delivery and these have been pivotal in our fight against rabies.
In the late 1970s, Switzerland pioneered the widespread deployment of enticing baits laced with rabies vaccine that would be eaten by rabies-susceptible wild animals, thereby protecting them.
So successful was this approach that following a similar campaign that spanned more than two decades, Germany was declared rabies-free.
Whilst development of an oral vaccine is scientifically feasible, it is unlikely ever to become a reality. As Dr Tarlinton explains: ""It was worth developing the oral bait vaccines for rabies because of the human zoonosis risk, but something for a purely veterinary disorder, particularly one that infects wildlife rather than livestock? It's difficult to justify the economics of doing it, even if we should.""
Even though vaccinating tigers is unfeasible there is an alternative: identify the reservoir and remove the virus at source through vaccination campaigns. This has proven very effective in protecting CDV-threatened lion populations in Africa.
But do we know what the reservoir is? Domestic dogs have been implicated in all epidemics involving wildlife but, because the virus can infect other animals, you have to be sure.
And this is what Dr McAloose and her colleagues have turned their attention to.
""We have to understand if there's a reservoir.
""We're trying to identify how the virus is cycling through the system to understand what the carriers are, and only with these results would we be able to make the appropriate recommendations.""
For the sake of the Amur tigers, I wish them well in their quest.","The Siberian tiger: majestic, enigmatic - the classic big cat precariously balanced on the edge of extinction.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Willard Wigan, 57, a micro-sculptor, creates pieces that sit within the eye of a needle or on a pin-head.

"Six councils in north-west England granted or renewed permits for more than 300 convicted drivers since 2012.
The mother of a Salford student killed by a man posing as a taxi driver said it was ""clearly wrong"" to give licences to sex offenders.
MP Andrew Gwynne has called for current legislation to be tightened.
The Licensed Taxi Drivers Association (LTDA) said granting licences to convicted drivers was ""putting the public at risk"".
A BBC investigation found one in five drivers applying for a taxi licence in the region over the last two years had a criminal record.
Forty-one councils were asked under the Freedom of Information Act to reveal how many convicted drivers were granted licences.
Of the six that responded, Blackpool, Burnley, Cheshire East, Sefton, Eden and Trafford councils granted or extended licences for drivers with convictions including:
Local Government Association guidelines state applicants convicted of sexual or violent offences should be refused a licence.
However, councils are free to decide who they consider to be ""fit and proper"" drivers, and can take into account the date of the offence, the circumstances, and the applicant's behaviour since.
Mr Gwynne, who represents Denton and Reddish, said he was concerned local authorities currently do not have powers over taxis licensed outside their area.
He said: ""What shouldn't be allowed to happen is people who have been refused on legitimate grounds can then scurry off to a neighbouring local authority where they have lesser standards and successfully apply for a licence that they have no intention of using in that local area.""
Undercover reporters from BBC Inside Out North West also found five private hire drivers over a two-hour period were willing to break the law and offer unbooked journeys in Manchester.
One driver said: ""There's no harm in it. Everybody's doing it.""
Current laws stipulate private hire taxi drivers are only allowed to operate after being pre-booked.
Bob Azam, a hackney carriage driver for 15 years, described the city's Northern Quarter as the ""Wild West"" of illegal touting.
""People just see the word taxi and think that's a legal vehicle to get into. It's just a matter of time until someone gets seriously hurt or sexually assaulted.""
Medical student Rachel Thacker was murdered 21 years ago when she got into a car she thought was a taxi.
Her battered and burnt body was found dumped in a skip in Ardwick. She could only be identified by her fingerprints.
Her killer, Duncan Bermingham, had borrowed the car from a friend and posed as a taxi driver.
Gill Thacker said her daughter's life had ended in ""the most horrendous circumstances"" and warned against getting into an unlicensed vehicle.
She said it was ""clearly wrong"" for drivers with sexual convictions to be granted licences.
""They shouldn't be allowed to be taxi drivers. I wouldn't have thought they'd have got a licence if they'd got convictions for sexual offences,"" she added.
Steve McNamara, general secretary of the LTDA, said: ""These drivers clearly fail to meet the fit and proper person test and should never have been in a position to transport members of the public.
""The problem is that councils set their own licensing standards and in some areas these are woefully inadequate - putting the public at risk.
""We believe that the government must take urgent action to address this by establishing a clear set of robust minimum licensing standards, applicable across all authorities.""
Five of the six councils who granted licences to convicted drivers defended their procedures and said a wide range of checking systems were in place.
Blackpool Council said it considered factors including the age of the conviction, the penalty imposed, and the applicant's conduct since the offence.
Burnley Council explained its decision to grant a licence to a driver with a sexual conviction, adding: ""Members took into account all the available evidence at the hearing and determined that the applicant was fit and proper.""
Trafford Council did not respond to requests for a comment.

"It follows claims of cronyism within the land and environmental services department.
A long-running internal investigation has been looking at a number of issues, including alleged procurement irregularities.
The department's executive director resigned last November.
Police Scotland said their inquiries were at an early stage.
BBC Scotland understands officers have taken an interest in issues that arose through Glasgow City Council's internal investigation and that the local authority would be willing to co-operate with police.
It is also understood that a meeting took place recently between the council and police and that some of the issues spoken about involved people outside the council.
The land and services department looks after services such as cleansing, bin collection, park, roads to environmental health and trading standards.
The department has about 4,000 employees and a revenue budget of Â£190m.
In November 2016 its executive director Brian Devlin - whose salary was about Â£120,000 - resigned after five years in the role.
It is understood that Mr Devlin was spoken to during the internal investigation.
The others interviewed by the internal investigators included two members of staff with close personal links to housing repair company Mears Scotland, which had also been at the centre of a local controversy over council contracts in neighbouring North Lanarkshire.
One is the son of its managing director who is married to Glasgow's Lord Provost Sadie Docherty.
The other is the partner of an executive with Mears who is now working in a different role at the council.
However, Mears currently has no major contracts with Glasgow City Council and the company has denied wrongdoing.
A spokesman for Labour-run Glasgow City Council said it would not be appropriate to comment on an ongoing internal investigation.
The broader issue of openness and transparency within Glasgow City Council is set to be a key theme in the campaign ahead of May's local elections.
Supporters of the Labour administration may argue that the internal investigation demonstrates that they take such matters seriously.
However, the SNP believe that, in general, the council could do more to ensure it is transparent and seen to be so.
The leader of the SNP group on the council, Susan Aitken, stressed she did not wish to comment on this specific investigation or any of the individuals concerned.
However, she said: ""Glasgow SNP have already expressed serious concerns about public trust in the council in the light of a number of incidents over the years and have committed to appoint an independent expert to conduct a root and branch review of governance if elected.""
The Times newspaper, which first reported the story in its Scottish edition, claimed the council's ties with Mears and a number of other firms were being looked at by the local authority's internal auditors.
In general, councils are expected to follow tight procurement rules and statutory procedures to ensure an open and transparent process is followed for any contract being awarded - major contracts also have to comply with EU law.
They should not be awarded on the basis of personal connections and no company tendering for a contract should be given an unfair advantage or disadvantage.
It would be seen as bad practice - and possibly a breach of rules - for anyone with a close personal connection to a company to be involved with decisions on whether or not they are awarded a contract.
Any allegation a council employee was able to give one company bidding for work an unfair advantage, through for instance sharing information, would also be taken very seriously.
Recommendations on who to award significant contracts to are made by council officials, although the actual decisions are taken by committees of councillors. It is unusual for these committees to go against the officials' recommendations.

"Bert Williams, 71, from Prenton, Wirral, caught the 93lb fish in the sea off Norway.
Mr Williams told the BBC he initially thought he had caught a dolphin and it took two anglers more than 25 minutes to land the fish off Soroya, Norway.
The catch is about 10lb off the world record for cod.
Shortly before, he had snagged his fishing line on the boat's engine and thought he'd done that again or ""landed a dolphin"" as a pod had just passed the boat.
Mr Williams, who began fishing when he was six years old, said: ""To get the thing out of the water, I had to pace myself. I wouldn't have been able to lift it in on my own.""
He said: ""Two of the guides on the fishing trip helped lift it into the boat and it took 25 minutes.""
Despite its size, Mr Williams said: ""I have caught a marlin bigger - it was 180lb.""
As well as being the biggest cod landed by a British angler, it is the biggest for a disabled angler - Mr Williams has a heart condition.

"The winning film, I Daniel Blake, marks the 13th time that Loach, the director of more than 50 movies, has competed at the event. It's also exactly 10 years since he won the same prize for his 2006 Irish drama The Wind That Shakes The Barley, starring Cillian Murphy.
Loach uses I, Daniel Blake to expose the welfare system in the UK, and says he wants the film ""to break audience's hearts, but also to make them angry"".
Daniel Blake, played by stand-up comedian Dave Johns, is an older man living in Newcastle who, because of a heart attack, can no longer do his job.
However, a mobility test by the Department of Work and Pensions declares him fit for work and while he waits for his appeal, Daniel Blake can only claim Jobseekers Allowance.
His inability to take any work offered means his money is stopped, and he begins to go hungry.
Loach, a social campaigner for most of his career, believes the current criteria for claiming benefits in the UK is ""a Kafka-esque, Catch 22 situation designed to frustrate and humiliate the claimant to such an extent that they drop out of the system and stop pursuing their right to ask for support if necessary"".
""The state's attitude is not an accident,"" he claims.
""The poverty, the indignity, the humiliation people go through is consciously done.
""The state is knowingly inefficient or cruel, knowing that people will be driven to frustration, despair, hunger and possible suicide.
""Claimants are portrayed as 'scroungers' in the media but research has found that less than 1% of claims for benefits are fraudulent.
""That's certainly less than the figures for tax evasion, for example.
""But there's an attitude that suggests that if you're poor, it's your fault. If you are out of a job, it's your fault. It's done to get the numbers down and the most vulnerable in our society are suffering as a result.""
Half a century ago, Ken Loach wrote the screenplay for the BBC play Cathy Come Home, which examined homelessness in Britain in 1966, and the director says his latest film ""is a snapshot of how life can be lived in Britain in 2016"".
""We wanted to explore the human consequences of welfare policy in terms of relationships, and who people become through these policies.""
Loach and his long-time collaborator, writer Paul Laverty, spent several months visiting British cities such as Stoke, Newcastle, Liverpool and Glasgow, meeting people seeking work, or on low-paid or zero-hour contracts.
""We started in my home town of Nuneaton and met a young lad there who was sleeping on a mattress in a charity home.
""He was doing the odd bit of work on zero-hour contracts, he'd given up on benefits - he said it was too humiliating.
""He hadn't worked for a couple of weeks, and the week before he hadn't eaten for four days.
""I opened his fridge and there was nothing in it - nothing at all. And this was one of the first people we encountered.""
Loach and Laverty say they also based a pivotal scene in the film, where a mother arrives at a food bank having not eaten for days, on a real anecdote from one of the centres they visited in Glasgow.
""Food banks have been praised by the state without any sense of shame at all and yet it's appalling in 2016 that people are having to make the choice between food and heating, which is common.
""After the war in 1945, we were desperately poor in Britain, but there is no way people would have been starving, their communities wouldn't have let them.
""That we now have this situation is testament to the policy of individualism that successive governments have pursued.
""It's shocking that we are apparently such a wealthy nation with such grotesque wealth at the top and such desperate poverty and fear at the very bottom.""
The film has won widespread acclaim from critics, with Variety magazine calling it ""one of Loach's finest films, a drama of tender devastation, a work of scalding and moving relevance"".
But despite its concentration on the UK welfare system, Loach, who will be 80 next month, insists that the movie also applies to an international audience.
""There is a conscious cruelty in the way we organise our lives now which means the most vulnerable people in society, such as the disabled, are caught in this unfair situation.
""They are often unable to live with dignity, and instead suffer pain and deep despair.
""It's deeply shocking that this is happening at the heart of our world.""

Hendry became the youngest-ever world champion, aged 21 in 1990, before adding six more in the next nine years.
He held the world number one ranking for eight consecutive years between 1990 and 1998 and then again briefly in 2006 and 2007.
Hendry, who lost to Willie Thorne on his World Championship debut in 1986, holds the record for the most world ranking titles (36) and the most competitive century breaks (775)
He also shares the record of most competitive maximum breaks with Ronnie O'Sullivan at 11.
After dominating the 1990s, Hendry's form started to tail off and he reached just one World Championship final in the next decade.
His last ranking tournament final was in the 2006 UK Championship where he lost to Peter Ebdon.

"Police say the man - said to be a former employee - entered the Ludlow restaurant in the Southbank area late on Sunday evening brandishing a knife.
Other customers and staff fled but the man cornered the woman in a back room and barricaded himself in.
The area was cordoned off while police negotiated with the man.
The woman was released unharmed in the early hours of Monday.
Police then moved in and Tasered the man before arresting him and taking him to hospital on a stretcher for checks.
Inspector Travis McCarthy told Australian media the investigation was ongoing but that the accused ""was fairly disgruntled around some employment issues with the restaurant"".
He said the woman appeared not to have been directly threatened during the siege.","A 35-year-old man has been arrested after a woman was held hostage in a restaurant in Melbourne, Australia, for seven hours.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The condition of the woman, who has not been named, was ""good, considering the circumstances"", the GIZ development organisation said.
She is ""very relieved and happy"" at being released, it added.
The kidnapping happened in a central Kabul neighbourhood, where a number of foreign aid agencies are based.
No details have been given about the circumstances of the woman's release.
German Foreign Minister Frank Walter-Steinmeier, who is visiting Tehran, said he was ""very relieved"" at the news and thanked the Afghan government and the country's security forces.
The kidnapping was the second abduction of a GIZ aid worker this year.
Another employee of the agency was kidnapped in the restive northern province of Kunduz and rescued in a police operation after 40 days in captivity.

"Three years after Russia annexed Crimea, a move bitterly contested by Ukraine's government, the region remains in a state of flux. It's difficult to get into, and for many people, it's difficult to know where it's going.
At Kiev International Airport, I hand my passport to a border guard.
""Purpose of visit?"" he asks.
""Journalism. I'm with the BBC.""
He pauses. He studies my passport. He seems to be checking a list. He goes to pick up a telephone and asks a question. He does not realise I can hear.
""You remember that pro-Russian journalist from the BBC? Was his surname Rosenberg?""
Another pause.
""It wasn't? OK, thanks."" He hangs up. He stamps my passport and returns it.
""Welcome to Ukraine!"" he smiles.
Those pauses at passport control are an indication of the current tension between Moscow and Kiev - a relationship clouded by enmity and suspicion.
Our BBC team is only passing through Kiev. Our final destination is Crimea, the Ukrainian peninsula annexed by Russia three years ago.
For journalists based in Russia, there are faster ways of reaching the Crimean peninsula. Board a plane in Moscow and two hours later you can be in the Crimean capital Simferopol. Ukraine, however, warns foreign nationals that anyone entering ""temporarily occupied Crimea"" without Kiev's permission and without crossing an official Ukrainian border may be banned from future entry to Ukraine.
We're taking the longer route.
Direct flights from Russia to Ukraine stopped in October 2015. We flew from Moscow to the Belarusian capital Minsk, then on to Kiev. Ahead of us is an eight-hour road trip to Crimea.
First, we visit the Ukrainian Migration Service in Kiev to obtain the ""dozvil"" - a document issued by the Ukrainian authorities permitting travel to Crimea. Three hours later, permission slips in hand, our long car journey south begins.
Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 was a watershed moment. It pushed Moscow and the West to the brink of a new cold war. Three years on we are travelling to Crimea to gauge the mood.
It is dark by the time we reach the final Ukrainian checkpoint before the peninsula. Ukraine does not call the Kalanchak crossing a border - officially, it is a ""control point for entry and exit"". We show our passports and dozvils. Minutes later we are waved through.
The no-man's land between the Ukrainian and Russian checkpoints is tiny - no more than 50m long. We stop here to change cars - our Kiev driver will turn back.  A driver from Simferopol has come to meet us.
On the Russian side this is called the Armyansk crossing. As far as the Russians are concerned, it is an official state border. We show passports and visas and fill out immigration cards. Our documents are in order, but we are asked to wait. The appearance here of British journalists has raised official eyebrows.
A young man in civilian clothes approaches me. ""Come with me, please,"" he says, ""I'd like to have a chat.""
We enter a small room and sit down at a table. He checks my phone to make sure I am not recording our conversation.
Then come the questions. Lots of them.
""What mission have your editors set you? What will you be filming? How will you be saving your material, on computers or hard drives? What SIM card will you be using in Crimea? As the correspondent, will you be making notes each night about what you have filmed? Can you show me some of the photos on your phone? Where will you be staying? Why didn't you fly direct from Moscow?""
My interrogator notes down my answers on a piece of paper. His questions are not limited to Crimea.
""What street do you live on in Moscow? What is the nearest Metro station to your home? What does your wife do for a living? You've been in Russia a long time. Have you ever considered applying for a Russian passport?""
""My British one suits me just fine,"" I reply.
""What do you think of English cuisine?"" he asks, adding, ""I like Jamie Oliver. Although I consider he uses too much oil.""
The questioning lasts an hour. Then the official escorts me back to the van. I ask for his name.
""I have no name,"" he replies, ""only a rank.""
The inquisitive young man with ""no name, only a rank"" invites my colleagues for similar conversations.
Three hours pass. Interrogations over, we are still not free to go. We spend the night in the van waiting for Russian customs officers to process our papers and allow our TV equipment through. Ten hours after arriving at the Armyansk crossing, we finally clear the checkpoint.
Simferopol is the administrative centre of Crimea. The name of our hotel is the ""Ukraine"". But three years after annexation, the town feels Russian. Most of the cars have switched to Russian number plates, brand new buses manufactured near Moscow have taken to the roads. And, peering down from billboards is the Russian president with some of his choicest Crimea quotations - just to remind everyone who is in charge.
""Crimea was famous for being the spa of the Soviet Union,"" declares Vladimir Putin in one poster. ""We will, of course, develop this.""
""All Russian army social programmes will be extended to Sevastopol and the Black Sea Fleet,"" he promises in another.
Near our hotel, the wall of a building is covered with a giant painting of President Putin dressed as a sailor and the words: ""Crimea belongs to all of us"".
As far as retired teacher Olga Koziko is concerned, the more Putin in Crimea, the better.
""Crimea is a place where people support Putin,"" Olga assures me. ""We just adore him. He's our hero. I even have a T-shirt with Putin and the words: 'In Putin We Trust', like 'In God We Trust.' Thanks to Putin, Russian soldiers came to protect us.""
On 22 February 2014, Ukraine's pro-Moscow president Viktor Yanukovych fled the country after what he - and his Russian allies - called an ""illegal coup"" in Kiev. On 27 February masked men in unmarked uniforms appeared in Simferopol. Armed with Russian weapons, they seized government buildings, the parliament, the airport and blocked Ukrainian army bases. This mysterious military force picked up a variety of nicknames, including The Little Green Men and The Polite People.
Today Moscow admits the soldiers were from Russia's secretive Special Operations Forces (the SSO). President Putin subsequently signed a decree making 27 February an annual celebration in Russia - ""Special Operations Forces Day"".
Following a hastily organised referendum, it was announced that more than 95% of people who had taken part had voted for Crimea's ""reunification"" with Russia. The referendum was not recognised by the international community. To the outside world, Russia had grabbed a piece of Ukraine.
A statue honouring The Little Green Men has been erected near the Crimean parliament building. It depicts a young girl handing flowers to a man with a gun. The inscription reads: ""To The Polite People from the grateful people of Crimea.""
This is how Moscow wants to be seen here: as a force for good, protecting the people of Crimea from violent Ukrainian nationalists. In 2014 Russia's state-controlled media characterised the new Ukrainian government as ""fascists"", ""neo-Nazis"" and an ""illegitimate junta''. Olga uses similar language as she recalls the past.
""Without Russia, a lot of people would have been killed here,"" maintains Olga. ""Ukrainian Nazis said Crimea would either be part of Ukraine or empty. People would have been oppressed. Perhaps even put in concentration camps.""
There is absolutely no evidence to substantiate Olga's claims.
Many of those in Crimea who welcome Moscow's rule see the bloody conflict in eastern Ukraine as confirmation that Russia is a safer home. They discount evidence that unrest in the Donbass was incited and bankrolled by Moscow.
Out on the street I get chatting to a pensioner called Nadezhda. Until recently her sister had been living in Luhansk, one of the self-proclaimed separatist republics in eastern Ukraine.
""Life in Luhansk is terrible,"" Nadezhda says. ""So I moved my sister to Crimea. I will do everything to make sure that kind of violence doesn't break out here.""
There is another reason why Nadezhda, an ethnic Ukrainian, trusts Moscow more than Kiev - it is out of nostalgia for Soviet times, when she regarded Moscow as her capital. Nadezhda describes Crimea joining Russia as ""a return to the Soviet Union.  Our generation was, is and will always be in the USSR. We will die in the Soviet Union.""
Nostalgia and fear are powerful feelings. But they are not enough to sustain pro-Russia sentiment in Crimea at the level of 2014.
Severing ties to Ukraine has brought problems. With economic links to Ukraine cut, the only way of keeping the peninsula supplied is by sea or air. That means higher prices. Moscow insists that will change once it has completed a road and rail bridge linking Crimea to the Russian mainland. The bridge is a multibillion-dollar statement that Moscow is here to stay.
As well as higher prices, there is Russian red tape.
I visit a document registration centre in Simferopol. More than two hundred people are queueing outside. They have come to exchange Ukrainian documents, like deeds for apartments, for Russian ones. Some people, like Alyona, have been queuing here all night.
""Life hasn't got better or worse,"" Alyona tells me, ""We're still standing in lines, like we always used to. Maybe some people had big expectations three years ago. But I don't believe in miracles.""
I ask Alyona if she could imagine Russia handing Crimea back to Ukraine.
""Nothing would surprise me any more,"" she laughs. ""I wouldn't be surprised if we suddenly ended up as part of Turkey. To be honest, I don't care if we're with China! The most important thing is that there is no war.
""I've learnt that your life can be turned upside down in a day. And there is nothing you can do about it. We're like pawns on a chessboard. They're playing with us. Today our place is in Russia. And tomorrow? Who knows. Maybe that's for the best: if we knew, we might have a heart attack.""
Across town, I meet Nadia. She is complaining to me about potholes.
""Where I live there are potholes everywhere,"" Nadia says. ""People have been hurting their legs. I've written to the authorities asking them to do something. They haven't lifted a finger.""
Nadia's disappointment extends further than pavements and roads.
""Many people here were happy, but there is disillusionment now,"" she tells me, ""because there is no investment and salaries and pensions are small. My pension is 8000 roubles ($140; Â£112) a month. Just about enough to cover utility bills and the medicines I need.""
I am talking to Nadia beside the statue of Ukraine's most famous 19th Century poet, Taras Shevchenko. It is Shevchenko Day and a group of twenty people have come here with flowers to mark the poet's birthday. Russian police have come, too - with cameras. They are filming everyone, including us. In Russian Crimea, public expressions of Ukrainian pride attract special attention.
Nadia is an ethnic Russian, but she is wearing a small Ukrainian flag.
""In my soul, Crimea is still part of Ukraine,"" Nadia tells me. ""I'm here because this statue is the last symbol of Ukraine left in Crimea.""
A woman called Lidiya overhears our conversation. She is furious.
""It was the Russian Empress Catherine the Great who built up Crimea,"" says Lidiya sternly.
""Well, if you're going to bring up history, we could go right back to the days of the Crimean khans,"" retorts Nadia.
Lidiya switches to modern history.
""Three years ago America was planning to station soldiers in three schools in Sevastopol,"" she claims. ""Nato troops wanted to be in Sevastopol. Crimea would have been wiped from the face of the earth.""
""How do you know that?"" I ask.
""I read it in the internet,"" she replies.
""Does that make it true?""
Lidiya changes tack.
""If people think they live badly in Crimea today, let them go and live in the Donbass in eastern Ukraine. They will be crying to come back here.""
We drive to the town of Bakhchysarai in central Crimea to meet Umer Ibragimov. Umer, a Crimean Tatar, is desperate for information about his son Ervin. In May 2016 Ervin was abducted late at night. CCTV cameras caught the moment he was seized by men in uniform and bundled into a vehicle.
""I've written to everyone asking for help,"" Umer tells me, ""from the bottom levels right up to the president. But there has been no information about my son.""
Ervin Ibragimov was a member of the executive board of the World Congress of Crimean Tatars. Since annexation, the Crimean Tatar community has come under pressure. Its elected representative body, the Mejlis, which had opposed the 2014 referendum on joining Russia, has been ruled an ""extremist organisation"" and banned.
Human rights group Amnesty International accuses the Russian authorities of ""systematic persecution"" of Crimean Tatars. This month the European Union's foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini concluded that ""the rights of the Crimean Tatars have been gravely violated"". Moscow denies the accusations.
Over piping hot tea, Umer tells me the story of his family. In World War Two, his father had fought in the Red Army.
""He was wounded and came home,"" Umer says. ""Ten days later, all Crimean Tatars were deported from their homeland.""
It was Josef Stalin who had ordered the deportation - an act of collective punishment and paranoia. The Soviet dictator suspected Crimean Tatars of collaborating with the Nazis. More than 230,000 people were forced on to cattle trains and transported to Central Asia.
""My mother and father told me later they'd be given just 15 minutes to gather their belongings,"" recalls Umer.
Umer grew up in Soviet Uzbekistan. Conscripted into the Soviet army in the late 1970s, he spent a year fulfilling his ""internationalist duty"" fighting in Afghanistan.
Umer looks at a photograph of his missing son.
""There is no justice,"" he says.
And yet this Crimean spring feels calmer than three years ago. While Russia and the West argue over sanctions, sovereignty and borders, it seems that most people here are just trying to get on with their lives, trying to adapt.
""Everything calmed down,"" artist Svitlana Gavrilenko says. ""Everyone who used to be 'pro' something - either pro-Russia or pro-Ukraine - everybody calmed down.""
Three years ago Svitlana had opposed annexation. Today her perspective has changed.
""A lot of small and medium-sized businesses fell apart after Russia came because they were all connected to Ukraine.  Now they have reconnected to Russia and China. If we become a part of Ukraine again, we will need to solve all this stuff again. Everyone's life is going to be screwed up again.""
In the Black Sea resort of Yalta I find the promenade packed with people enjoying a seaside stroll in the sunshine. The sound of the waves crashing on the shore mixes with jazz chords from street musicians.  From the conversations, there is an overriding sense of a population desperate for peace.
""Many people in Crimea still love Ukraine,"" Rodion says. ""Russia and Ukraine are too similar, their peoples too inter-connected to feel bad about each other.""
Rodion believes ""it's not completely impossible"" that Crimea would one day return to Ukrainian rule.
""Nobody ever imagined it would become a part of Russia,"" he says, though he resents Western leaders who demand the peninsula's return. ""Crimea is not just a thing to be given to one country or another. It's a place. It's the people who live here. It's history. It's many things that cannot be bought or inter-changed.""
Svitlana Gavrilenko believes that the changes that took place here three years ago are irreversible.
""I don't think Russia in its modern state, with Putin at the top, could ever give Crimea back,"" she tells me. ""They made so much effort to connect it. They suffered through all these sanctions just to have Crimea. Why would they give it back?""",Pictures are copyright BBC and Getty Images,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Daniel Pike, 28, spent two years building the hut near Watford, but was removed from it earlier this month.
He said his hut at Merry Hill Wood has now been flattened by the Woodland Trust, which owns the land.
The trust said it is required to safeguard the area and had offered Mr Pike advice about moving on.

Mr Pike built the hut from clay he found at the site, kitted it out with solar panels, and constructed an outdoor shelter with a seating area and cooking facilities.
He previously said being there had given him freedom and meant he could live ""without being coerced"".

However, bailiffs arrived on 7 September, accompanied by police, and he was arrested at the scene for obstructing a court official in the execution of his duty.
He said: ""It was all done very ruthlessly with no care or consideration for what I was saying.""
Mr Pike, who spent a night in a police cell and received a fine, said the hut had since been destroyed.

"Militants led by the jihadist Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (Isis) took over parts of the cities of Falluja and Ramadi in late December.
Since then, troops and allied tribesmen have struggled to regain control.
The number displaced by the unrest is the highest since the peak of the sectarian insurgency from 2006 to 2008.
A further 1.1 million internally displaced people (IDPs) have still not returned to communities in Iraq wracked by violence since 2003.
By Nahed  AbouzeidBBC Arabic, Baghdad
The tourist village of Habbaniya, south-west of Falluja, was once a popular destination for the Iraqi elite during Saddam Hussein's rule. It has now turned into a refuge for those fleeing the fighting in Anbar.
Inside the village's chalets and seven-story hotel are hundreds of families, crammed into rooms that lack adequate sanitation and other basic facilities.
In the absence of appropriate medical care due to the army's blockade of the area, skin diseases and viral and bacterial infections are spreading uncontrollably. Children and women are the most vulnerable, especially pregnant women who cannot get access to female doctors.
The main roads in and out of Fallujah and Ramadi are part of the battlefield as the army aims to secure supply routes for troops and tries to cut off militant groups.
The UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said some 50,000 families had fled their homes since clashes erupted in Ramadi and Falluja after security forces dismantled a long-standing anti-government protest camp led by the Sunni Arab community.
While security forces backed by pro-government tribesmen have made steady progress in retaking areas of Ramadi, they have not launched an offensive to recapture Falluja, fearing a repeat of the two bloody urban battles US troops fought in the city in 2004.
Over the weekend, Anbar Governor Ahmed al-Dulaimi gave the militants a week to surrender, but said officials would not negotiate with Isis.
""With the conflict in Anbar continuing UN agencies continue to receive reports of civilian casualties and sustained hardship in communities impacted by the fighting and the influx of internally displaced persons,"" said UNHCR spokeswoman Melissa Fleming.
Most of the displaced had fled to outlying communities in Anbar province, while 60,000 had ended up in more distant provinces, she added. Many are living in schools, mosques and other public buildings and urgently needed humanitarian aid.
In Anbar, Ms Fleming said access remained a challenge, citing reports that a consignment of World Health Organisation (WHO) medical supplies had been detained at an Iraqi army checkpoint since 30 January.
Many bridges have also been destroyed and roads blocked.","Up to 300,000 people have now been displaced by the fighting between Sunni militants and security forces in Iraq's western province of Anbar, the UN says.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"This means none of the president's supporters will go to the ICC.
His long-time rival Laurent Gbagbo is on trial for war crimes at the ICC over the civil war sparked by his refusal to accept defeat in the 2010 election.
Both sides were accused of atrocities during the four-month conflict, which left some 3,000 people dead.
Mr Outtara said Ivory Coast now has an operational justice system so future prosecutions will happen in national courts.
He was speaking during a meeting in Paris with his French counterpart Francois Hollande.
Campaign group Human Rights Watch has warned that the ICC gave a ""perception of victor's justice"" by only prosecuting one side of Ivory Coast's conflict.
Mr Gbagbo's trial in The Hague, in the Netherlands, started in January and is likely to last three to four years.
Mr Gbagbo and ex-militia leader Charles Ble Goude deny murder, rape, attempted murder and persecution.
The ICC also accuses pro-Gbagbo militias of attacking members of ethnic groups believed to support Mr Ouattara.
But pro-Ouattara forces were also accused of similar atrocities and these have not been prosecuted in the ICC.
Last year, several former leaders of the pro-Ouattara rebels were indicted in Ivory Coast.
Among them is Cherif Ousmane, who remains a high-ranking officer in the presidential guard.
None of them is currently under arrest, reports the BBC Afrique's Abdourahmane Dia.
The ICC had issued an arrest warrant for Mr Gbagbo's wife, Simone, too, but this was dismissed by the Ivorian government.

"L/Cpl David Gwilt from Bedford, and rifleman Dale Harris from Barnsley, died in the collision near Cullybackey in August 2014.
The 24-year-olds had been serving in the 2nd Battalion The Rifles, based at Thiepval Barracks in Lisburn.
Their colleague, rifleman Matthew Robins, escaped major injury.
Mr Robins told Belfast Coroner's Court how the three had left the barracks that morning to spend some time fishing.
He said the friends had stopped at two lakes and were on the way to find another spot to fish when the accident happened.
The soldier said he recalled being in the front passenger seat of the car as they drove along, but had no memory of the crash that followed.
""The next thing I remember I was in the ambulance and a paramedic was on the phone to my missus,"" he said.
Mr Robins, also from England, later told the coroner that none of the men were familiar with the roads in that part of County Antrim.
Jordan Marks was driving the tractor and trailer along the Ballyconnelly Road at around 20:00 BST when the silver Fiat Punto owned and driven by Mr Gwilt emerged from a junction.
""I just got a sight of a car flying out of the junction,"" Mr Marks said.
The vehicle collided with the front of the tractor and spun around before crashing into a road sign.
A retired doctor and two off-duty nurses were among the first to come upon the scene of the crash.
Despite their efforts, the two soldiers were declared dead at the site. Mr Gwilt was in the driver's seat and Mr Harris was in the back passenger seat behind him.
A road traffic collision investigator said the junction at the approach to the Ballyconnelly Road was clearly marked with signs and road markings.
""The Fiat was required to stop by the road markings and signage,"" he said.
Mr Dunn said it was not possible to determine the exact speed the soldiers' car was travelling at, but added: ""It was not moving at a relatively slow speed.""
Assessing the conclusions of the expert's report, the coroner said: ""The bottom line is the car failed to stop at the junction and very tragically that led to a collision with the tractor and the deaths of the driver and passenger.""
A policeman told the coroner there had been a ""collision history"" at the junction and explained there was another side road directly opposite the road the soldiers were travelled on - giving the impression of one continuing road.
""If you weren't paying close attention you might miss the junction completely,"" he said.
The coroner heard that Transport NI has agreed to introduce additional safety measures at the junction - such as 'rumble strip' road paint to give drivers further warning to slow down and high visibility bordering around the stop signs.
The coroner welcomed the steps.
""I always hope something will arise out of a tragedy that will improve matters and may prevent the occurrence of something similar,"" he said.
Recording the deaths as being the result of a road crash, the coroner extended his sympathies to the relatives of the two soldiers and again commended all those who had attempted to save them.","Two soldiers were killed when their car failed to stop at a junction and crashed into a tractor in County Antrim, an inquest has heard.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Two spacecraft have been ordered at a cost of roughly 550m euros (Â£405m).
They will be built at the aerospace giant's factories in Portsmouth and Stevenage in southern England.
Inmarsat specialises in providing mobile connections to ships, planes, oil and gas platforms, and the broadcasting industry.
The new spacecraft will be known as the Inmarsat-6 series. They will update services currently offered in the L-band part of the radio spectrum.
These connections are handled today by the Inmarsat-4 series, which was launched in 2005. The expectation is that these earlier platforms will be operational until at least 2020, by which time the I-6s should be ready for lift-off.
Inmarsat's decision to place the order with Airbus is a major boost for UK space manufacturing.
The telecoms company is the world's biggest player in its field, and so the Airbus workers in Portsmouth and Stevenage will see the contract as a tremendous endorsement of their skills and expertise.
It will also be regarded as a very positive return on the strategy pursued by ministers and the UK Space Agency, who have targeted R&D investments in the telecoms sector.
This has seen, for example, the development of state-of-the-art digital signal processors for satellites that can channel significant bandwidth and power to specific locations on the ground at the drop of a hat.
In addition to being more capable than the I-4s, the I-6s will differ in two key respects.
One is their frequency of operation. As well as the L-band, which is where Inmarsat has many legacy services, the new satellites will carry a Ka-band payload.
This higher frequency part of the radio spectrum is where much of the new sector growth will occur - such as in-flight connections for aeroplanes.  Inmarsat recently launched an I-5 series of satellites. These all operate in Ka.
The other big difference from the I-4s, and indeed the I-5s, will be the new satellites' architecture. They will be what are called ""all-electric"" spacecraft.
This means they will use an ion engine to manoeuvre themselves once they come off the top of the launch rocket.
This is normally done with a large chemical thruster, but a significant mass saving can be made if the final orbital positioning is done using an engine that spits out a stream of charged gas.
Such ion engines, although extremely efficient, do however take longer to achieve the task in hand, resulting in a delay of several months to get the satellite on-station.
The plus side for the satellite owner is that they can use the mass saving either to select a smaller, cheaper rocket or to add additional payload capability.

"The Commission on Widening Access said there was an ""undeniable case for change"" on the issue.
But it acknowledged the move would be ""divisive"", with concerns that middle-class students could be displaced.
The commission was set up by the first minister last year.
It was tasked with advising the Scottish government on how best to achieve its goal of ending the big gap between the number of students from wealthy and deprived backgrounds going to university.
The commission's interim report said there had been ""steady progress"" on the issue over the past decade.
But it stressed that ""very significant socioeconomic inequalities"" remained which were ""unfair, unsustainable and detrimental to Scotland"", and said the country had a moral and economic duty to tackle the issue
The report said it had been suggested that admitting students from deprived backgrounds with lower grades could have a detrimental impact on the academic excellence of Scotland's universities.
But it stated: ""There is increasingly strong evidence that with the right support, bright students from deprived backgrounds can enhance, rather than jeopardise, academic excellence.""
The report said other opposing viewpoints included:
But it added: ""Unless we are prepared to accept the notion that Scotland's talent is concentrated in its most affluent communities, it is clear that, through accident of birth, a whole section of Scottish society has nothing like an equal opportunity to maximise their talent and reap the benefits of higher education.
""We believe that this is fundamentally unfair and that the ultimate goal of widening access should be to eliminate socioeconomic inequality.
""Equality of access is not just a passport to a better life for individuals; it is also a passport to a fairer, better Scotland.""
The report also said there was strong evidence that parental experience of higher education was one of the most influential factors in determining the likelihood of a child entering university.
It added: ""This means that equal access is capable of transmitting the social and economic benefits of higher education between generations, breaking cycles of deprivation and contributing to a society that is healthier, wealthier and fairer.
""The evidence shows that a higher education is a passport to a better life. Graduates benefit from higher wages, significantly improved health outcomes and a higher life expectancy.
""We believe that Scotland has a moral duty to ensure that these opportunities are distributed fairly.""
The commission's final report is expected to be submitted next year.
The interim report was welcomed by Education Secretary Angela Constance, who said more needed to be done to tackle inequality in education despite the progress that had been made in recent years.
A spokeswoman for Universities Scotland said: ""Contextual admissions can help with this and it is one of many tools, but definitely not a silver bullet, that universities can use to help widen access.
""Universities will always look for the best and brightest applicants - our quality and excellence is very important to us and absolutely will not be compromised - but we are open-minded about what best and brightest actually means.""","Scottish universities should consider admitting students from deprived backgrounds whose grades are lower than their more affluent counterparts, according to a report.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Scotland's chief statistician estimated services grew by 0.5% and production by 0.3% between April and June, while construction contracted by 1.9%.
UK output as a whole grew by 0.7% over the same period.
Over the past year, the Scottish economy grew by 0.7% - a third of the UK rate of 2.1%.
In the first three months of the year, there was no growth in Scotland.
Scottish GDP per person - which takes population changes into account - grew by 0.3% during the second quarter, compared with 0.4% for the UK.
The report indicated that growth in Scottish GDP over the past year was driven by growth in the services industry, particularly in business services and finance.
However, that was ""tempered"" by contractions in the construction and production industries, especially electricity and gas, following the closure in March of Scotland's last coal-fired power station.
It was estimated that the closure resulted in a reduction of Scottish GDP of about 0.2 percentage points in the second quarter.
The economic report added: ""As this was a one-off closure it will not have an ongoing impact on the growth of the Scottish economy.""
Reacting to the figures, Scottish Chambers of Commerce chief executive Liz Cameron said it was ""good news"" that Scotland's economic growth rate had increased but added that there was ""still a great deal of work to be done"".
She said: ""To put this in perspective, the Scottish economy has grown in a year at almost the same rate that the UK economy has grown in just three months.
""These figures underline the fact that Scotland's economic performance has been significantly lower than that of the UK as a whole for a full year and, whilst we are now seeing welcome growth in our production and service sectors, construction has been contracting at a significant rate for two consecutive quarters.""
Colin Borland, head of external affairs in Scotland for the Federation of Small Businesses, said: ""These pre-referendum statistics might feel like a history lesson, but they teach us that Scottish growth was weak even before June's historic vote.
""Scotland needs to strive for growth levels at least as good as the UK average.

"The rate of deforestation has increased so much that Indonesia has for the first time surpassed Brazil in the rate of its clearance of tropical forests.
The study was published in the journal Nature Climate Change.
Scientists monitored the growth of deforested land in Indonesia between 2000 and 2012 using satellites.
They say the land was cleared to make way for palm oil plantations and other farms.
By 2012, the loss of primary forest every year in Indonesia was estimated to be higher than that in Brazil, said scientists.
In that year, Indonesia lost 8,400 sq km of forest compared to Brazil which lost 4,600 sq km.
The researchers, from the University of Maryland, said that deforestation had led to an increase in greenhouse gas emissions and a loss of biodiversity.
Indonesia has 10% of the world's plants and 12% of the world's mammals. It is known for its diverse wildlife which includes orangutans and Sumatran tigers.
A government moratorium on deforestation was signed in 2011 and was intended to slow down the pace of deforestation.
But environmental activists say corrupt politicians are quick to sell off huge swathes of rainforests for profit, and they point to the need for more monitoring and sanctions to stop the rate at which Indonesia is losing its forests, says the BBC's Karishma Vaswani.
Massive forest fires in Indonesia to clear land last year caused a heavy smog to blanket neighbouring Malaysia and Singapore, triggering health concerns in those countries.
Norway has pledged a billion dollars to Indonesia if it can prove it is serious about stopping deforestation.
Agencies report that Norway has paid almost $50 million to Indonesia to help set up new institutions to reduce deforestation.
But Indonesia will only start to get large amounts of money if deforestation is slowed down.","A new study has shown that Indonesia lost about 60,000 sq km of virgin forest - an area close to the size of Ireland - over a period of 12 years.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The 23-year-old, in his eighth Test, was dropped three times but reached an entertaining hundred from 104 balls.
England claimed two wickets in five balls early on but left-hander De Kock shared in stands of 50 and 82 and was unbeaten on 129 as his team made 475.
In reply Alex Hales fell cheaply but Alastair Cook held firm with 67.
South Africa resumed on 329-5 with De Kock on 29 and added 146 runs in 42 overs before they were bowled out midway through the afternoon session.

Fast bowler Kagiso Rabada claimed two early England wickets, trapping Nick Compton for 19 with one that pitched halfway down the wicket but hit barely above the boots.
The increasingly uneven bounce will give South Africa, who have already lost the series, hope of a consolation victory.
England's new opener Hales, playing his seventh Test innings, struck three fluent boundaries in his 15 from 14 balls, with consecutive attractive strokes to the fence through the off-side off the back foot.
But in the sixth over he skewed a loose drive, which was comfortably caught at backward point.
Former England captain Michael Vaughan told Test Match Special: ""It was a terrible dismissal. He gifted an opportunity and it is another one to put in the list of failures.
""He looks in two minds at the crease, unsure whether to go for the full-on aggressive shot or a checked drive.""
Hales, who has passed 50 only once in seven innings in the series, is the eighth opening partner for Cook since the retirement of former skipper Andrew Strauss in 2012.
The current captain showed a welcome return to form, however, looking assured in his first fifty of the series - and the 47th of his Test career - and is only 50 short of becoming the first England player to score 10,000 Test runs.
Joe Root edged a delivery fractionally short of De Kock behind the stumps as the occasional ball misbehaved but England's two leading batsmen put on 60 to take them to the close without further loss.
Having reprieved centurions Stephen Cook and Hashim Amla with dropped catches on day one, England were guilty of further errors in the field as South Africa pressed on to a commanding first innings total.
In only the third over of the day De Kock scythed James Anderson to gully where a diving Ben Stokes could not grasp the chance.
On 80, De Kock edged the luckless Chris Woakes and bisected wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow and wide first slip Alastair Cook, neither of whom went for the catch.
Ten runs later, De Kock's drive at Moeen Ali went through the hands of Cook at short extra-cover.
The left-hander played an array of shots all around the wicket and was particularly severe on Moeen Ali.
He scored 45 runs off the spinner in only 28 balls, including two mighty leg-side sixes, one of which nearly landed on a cameraman behind the long-on boundary.
Former South Africa wicketkeeper Mark Boucher: ""The pitch is not going to get any better; those cracks are going to widen. Batting from now on is going to be hard graft. In the last innings it will be a real lottery.
""You do feel that if South Africa get it right in a session, they will do some proper damage. You could have a session where England go 60-4.""
Ex-England skipper Michael Vaughan: ""There's going to be more low bounce over the next three days. You're under a lot of pressure when a team gets 475 on the board - you're only one bad session away from losing the match.

"Former party leader Mark Durkan, who has been the MP for the area since 2005, lost out by just 169 votes to Elisha McCallion of Sinn Féin.
Londonderry's city seat had been coveted by the SDLP since their party founder John Hume was elected in 1983.
All 18 of Northern Ireland's MPs have been confirmed with the SDLP and Ulster Unionist Party the biggest losers.
At the last general election in 2015, Mr Durkan was 8,000 votes clear of his nearest rival with 42% of the vote.
""I cannot tell a lie,"" he said in his concession speech.
""I cannot say it doesn't hurt but I absolutely want to begin by congratulating Elisha McCallion and agreeing with her that what she has achieved tonight is a privilege, to represent the people of this city.""
The Foyle turnout was 65.60% - up from 53.58% two years ago.
While not exactly a political newcomer, Ms McCallion only became an MLA at Stormont earlier this year following the death of Martin McGuinness.
In an emotional speech after the result, she recognised Mr Durkan's contribution to political life in the North West.
""Mark has been a public representative in Derry for a large number of years and he has served it well,"" she said. ""But I can't not express my extreme delight at being the first ever republican MP ever elected in this city.""
Mr Durkan said one of the reasons for his defeat was greater campaign funding by Sinn Féin.
He also felt that a reluctance from other parties to engage in a ""progressive alliance"" along pro-EU lines had been damaging.
""We were faced with a huge effort and a huge spend by Sinn Féin, they targeted the constituency very well and put huge resources in here,"" he told the BBC.
""It's a big part of it, if we can't match that spend or that spin.""
SDLP leader Colum Eastwood, who also hails from Derry, will now have a big job on his hands to pick the party up from their Westminster whitewash.
Stephen Pound, the Labour MP for Ealing North and shadow minister for Northern Ireland, said Mr Durkan's loss from the house of Commons would be keenly felt.
""Mark was without a doubt one of the finest speakers in the House of Commons, he was also the inventor of these incredible 'Durkanisms',"" Mr Pound told BBC Radio Foyle.
""He was one of the few people that made everybody stop rustling the papers and look up when he started speaking, he'll be missed greatly.

"It will cease operation at the end of August, after being told it would no longer receive legal aid funding.
The Legal Aid Agency (LAA) ruled the firm had breached contractual requirements.
Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said the firm's closure was the ""right outcome for our armed forces"".
The LAA took its decision after reviewing information submitted by the firm, following a Solicitors Regulation Authority investigation.
PIL, which has offices in London and Birmingham, represented complainants in the Â£31m Al-Sweady inquiry into a 2004 battle in southern Iraq.
The firm was criticised when the inquiry's 2014 report concluded that the subsequent war crimes allegations were based on ""deliberate lies, reckless speculation and ingrained hostility"".
That report concluded the behaviour of some soldiers towards detainees breached the Geneva convention, but was highly critical of the claims it was initially set up to investigate.
These were that Iraqi detainees had been murdered, mutilated and tortured following the Battle of Danny Boy on 14 May 2004 near Al Amarah in southern Iraq.
The report found that British forces responded to a deadly ambush by insurgents with ""exemplary courage, resolution and professionalism"".
And it suggested some detainees - all described as members or supporters of the Mahdi Army insurgent group - lied about the most serious allegations, so as to discredit the British armed forces.
In 2010 PIL called for a full public inquiry into allegations made by 142 Iraqi civilians that they were abused by British soldiers in southern Iraq.
The firm's lead lawyer Phil Shiner said that the case ""raises a number of very troubling systemic issues about the practices and techniques used on Iraqis"".
He also called for a single inquiry into the UK's detention policy in Iraq.
In January 2014 PIL submitted a legal bid with the International Criminal Court to prosecute British politicians and senior military figures, for alleged war crimes in Iraq - a move which the then Foreign Secretary William Hague said should be rejected. It submitted the bid along with the European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights.
Speaking at the time, Mr Shiner said the move was ""about individual criminal accountability for war crimes"".
It led to an initial investigation into claims that UK forces abused Iraqi detainees being opened by the ICC.
And in September 2015 PIL and the ECCHR submitted further evidence, which the ICC says added ""substantively to the allegations... expanding the list of alleged crimes in relation to new cases of alleged detainee abuses"".
Mr Fallon said the UK's armed forces ""show bravery and dedication in difficult circumstances"".
""For too long, we've seen our legal system abused to impugn them falsely. We are now seeing progress and we will be announcing further measures to stamp out this practice.""
A Number 10 spokesman said: ""We made a manifesto commitment to addressing these types of spurious claims that companies like PIL are pursuing.
""The closure of PIL shows that we are making progress on that, tackling these types of firms head on to make sure we get the right outcome for our armed forces who show such bravery in the most difficult of circumstances.""
The spokesman also said ministers were considering a ""suite of measures"" to prevent firms making bogus claims, including strengthening the penalties for abusers of the system.","The law firm Public Interest Lawyers, which submitted multiple allegations of misconduct by British troops during the Iraq War, is to close.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Councillor Amanda Chadderton, cabinet member for education and early years, said: ""We take any allegations about our schools very seriously and always investigate in the interests of pupils, staff and parents.

"Statistics gained under the Freedom of Information Act show nine councils have reduced how much they plan to spend.
It has led to concern that vulnerable groups are denied support some carers call ""light at the end of the tunnel"".
The Welsh Government said it was up to councils to ensure they had necessary respite placements.
According to figures provided by 21 of the 22 local authorities to BBC Wales, cuts have been made to defined respite budgets in Blaenau Gwent, Ceredigion, Neath Port Talbot, Newport, Swansea and Torfaen.
In Carmarthenshire, Conwy and Monmouthshire, the overall residential care budget, which includes provision for respite, has been cut.
In several other counties the budget for respite in 2011-12 was up on last year, but in some cases represented a cut on previous years.
No figures were provided by Anglesey council.
The figures show Swansea Council has cut its internal provision respite budget for older people and younger adults by over 80% in the last two years.
In 2009-10 it spent over £680,000, but this year the budget is less that £108,000.
Director of social services Chris Maggs admits the council is operating in a tough financial climate, but insists the changes will improve choice.
""We're faced with some incredible challenges as local authorities, and we obviously need to look at how we use all of our resources."" said Mr Maggs.
The council has decided to transfer money from respite care into its own residential homes, who will provide short breaks in the future.
""What we're doing is re-using our money,"" he said.
""Whilst it is true that we're reducing the total amount of money, we're also improving the range of services we have by using our existing services in a different way, so it maximises what we've actually got.""
But the potential changes have angered some families who depend on respite care.
Suzanne Hayes, from Rhossili, near Swansea, is a carer for her 27-year-old stepson John, who has cerebral palsy.
She described the six weeks of respite allocation they are given every year as ""light at the end of a tunnel"", but she feels strongly that the family need more support.
""John needs to have breaks because he can mix with different people,"" she said.
""We live in a beautiful area, but it is very isolating for John.""
The short respite breaks also give the family time to recover while John is away.
""It's not the big things, it's going for a coffee. It's having your own knife and fork in your hands, because we have to feed John.""
According to the charity Carers Wales, respite provision is already in short supply, but the cuts being made by local authorities will limit support even further.
""For individual families if a respite service which they've relied on gets cut, that's a real problem,"" said director Roz Williamson.
""But for most families, the problem is that they can't get access to anything - so the qualification for getting any help from a local authority keeps going up and up and up - so most families get nothing.""
A consultation on the future of respite care in Wales has recently closed, following an independent review which said there was ""a strong case for funding more outcome focussed respite services in Wales"".
The Welsh Government said it recognised ""the important role that respite care has in supporting individuals and families at what can be an extremely difficult time"".

The two former aides are charged with conspiring to misuse Port Authority property to punish Mayor Sokolich, a Democrat.
Mr Christie, who was once considered a favourite for the Republican presidential nominations, first became embroiled in the scandal in January 2014, when revelations from a series of emails and texts showed that traffic congestion on the George Washington Bridge may have been more than just routine maintenance.
Mr Christie's administration justified the closures as part of a traffic study, but Port Authority officials later said the study did not exist.
The congestion ended after five days, when an aide to New York's Democratic Governor Andrew Cuomo reopened the lanes over concerns of public safety.
Federal prosecutors opened an investigation and indicted three members of Mr Christie's aides in 2015, alleging that two of the key bridge's three lanes were closed in retaliation over Mayor Soklich's refusal to endorse the governor in his re-election bid.
The governor was not charged in connection to the scheme and has denied any involvement.
Mr Wildstein avoided going to trial by pleading guilty to charges of conspiracy to commit fraud on a federally funded property and a civil rights violation.
Ms Kelly and Mr Baroni have pleaded not guilty to the charges.
Mr Wildstein's dramatic testimony follows weeks of renewed questions over whether Mr Christie was aware of the political retribution.
After the governor dropped out of the Republican primary race earlier this year, concerns over ""Bridgegate"" were overshadowed by his surprising move to endorse his former rival, Donald Trump, for the White House.
But last week, federal prosecutors alleged that the governor was informed of the plot, using Mr Wildstein's testimony to argue their claim.
Prosecutors revealed photographs of Mr Wildstein, Mr Baroni and the governor laughing together at the 2013 memorial service, suggesting that they were taken during the conversation about the bridge closure.
At an event in Trenton, New Jersey later on Tuesday, the governor again denied any knowledge.
""I had no knowledge prior to or during"" the closures, he said. ""There's been no evidence ever put forward that I did.
Mr Wildstein's testimony follows last month's revelations that former Christie ally Christina Renna allegedly texted her colleague, Peter Sheridan, about the governor's knowledge of the plot.
""He just flat out lied about senior staff and [former campaign manager Bill Stepien] not being involved,"" she allegedly texted, referring to comments Mr Christie made during a news conference that year.
Republicans are probably thanking their lucky stars - as much as they can these days - that Donald Trump didn't go with what was reportedly his gut instinct and pick Chris Christie to be his vice-presidential running mate.
If the New Jersey governor had ended up on the ticket, the party would be facing a huge ""Bridgegate"" distraction on the eve of the one and only vice-presidential debate.
Of more proximate concern for Mr Christie at this point is that the latest revelations will make it increasingly difficult for him to have any sort of high-profile job in a possible Trump administration.
He would likely be savaged by the Senate if he stood for confirmation for a Cabinet position such as attorney general.
Given that the unpopular Christie has little future in New Jersey elective politics, the ""Bridgegate"" trial could be closing his only lane to continued political relevance.","New Jersey Governor Chris Christie laughed about his staff closing part of a bridge in 2013 over a mayor who refused to endorse him, a court heard.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Lost and homeless, in a city he doesn't know, you'd forgive him for cursing his luck from time to time.
But Paddington is the politest of bears and would surely never say anything bad, right?
However, the family adventure about a talking bear has been awarded a PG certificate instead of a U. Here's why:
Okay, this is putting it a bit strongly, but the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) has said that there is some ""mild innuendo"" in the film.
Enough to warrant an appearance on Scott Mills's Innuendo Bingo? Probably not.
But there's one sequence highlighted by the BBFC where ""a man disguised as a woman is flirted with by another man.""
Let's be honest unless you're a Paddington superfan, have children or have a teddy bear obsession, you're probably not going to go and see this film.
It's primarily been made for kids - and it follows that kids copy things they see on the big screen.
So what are the BBFC trying to stop these impressionable young viewers from doing?
Well, there's one scene where ""Paddington (is) hiding from a villain inside a refrigerator.""
But turning Paddington from a chilly bear in to a polar bear isn't the board's only concern.
Our loveable hero is also seen ""riding on a skateboard while holding onto a bus, as well as a brief scene of a boy strapping fireworks to his shoes.""
Who would possibly want to hurt a cute, cuddly bear like Paddington? Nicole Kidman, that's who.
The Australian actress plays the film's villain and she's out to ""kill and stuff"" Paddington.
And (spoiler alert), she comes close too. Viewers will see our pawed protagonist spread unconscious on a table, while an evil taxidermist prepares tools nearby.
But it's not just in London that Paddington needs to keep his wits about him.
""There is also a short scene in a jungle when Paddington and his family run for shelter during an earthquake with trees falling around them,"" according to the BBFC.
On the whole Paddington is as sweet as the marmalade he devours.
His manners are immaculate, barring the odd dining table faux pas, but there is one solitary ""mumbled use of 'bloody'"" which is enough to cause concern for the BBFC.
Contrary to other reports, the BBFC has told Newsbeat that Paddington was always classified as a PG film and has not been upgraded from a ""U"" certificate.
The board defended its decision and said its guidelines are reviewed every four to five years.
""The most recent review of the guidelines, in 2013, involved more than 10,000 member of the public from across the UK.
""The 2013 review found that 92% of film viewers agreed with the classification of films and videos they had seen recently.""

"The four-piece group and their manager, who were aged between 19 and 32, died in the early hours of 13 February following a gig in Stockholm.
Their car crashed into a raised section of a bridge and plummeted into a canal.
The inquest heard no alcohol or drugs was found in the blood of manager Craig Tarry, 32, who was driving.
Post-mortem examinations also showed the four band members had not taken drugs and had only consumed small amounts of alcohol.
The band's agent Graham Bennett told the inquest at Warrington Coroner's Court that the up-and-coming group were in Sweden for a festival showcasing young artists.
Viola Beach had already played at the Reading and Leeds festivals last year and the Stockholm event was their first gig outside the UK.
After the performance, they were travelling in a black Nissan Qashqai near the SÃ¶dertÃ¤lje Canal, about 18 miles from the capital, when a bridge was raised to let a boat pass underneath.
The inquest heard that the car was slightly over the speed limit as it was travelling at 108km/h (67mph) in a 100km/h zone.
Flashing lights signalled that the bridge was about to be raised with the middle section of the road lifted horizontally, the inquest heard.
Mr Tarry drove down a verge past stationary queuing traffic and through the first set of barriers, about 120m from the bridge, the court heard.
The car then travelled in a ""controlled manner"" at between 70 and 90km/h down the centre of the road.
It continued through a second set of barriers - 30m from the drop into the canal - and hit the raised section of the bridge before plummeting 25m, hitting the water within 15 seconds.
The court heard a tanker using the canal, which had requested the bridge to be lifted, then passed over the crash spot and ""contact"" with the car could not be ruled out.
The crew of a passing boat saw the car fall but initially thought it was ice.
Technical examinations did not find any errors with the car, barrier system or the procedure for raising the bridge.
One warning light on the bridge was out of order but there were at least 10 warning lights and flashing signals, the inquest heard.
Although the road was wet, it was not frozen with ice.
Post-mortem examinations found that all died from head injuries apart from Mr Lowe whose cause of death was given as drowning.
The court heard that the three band members sitting in the back of the car were not wearing seatbelts but those in the front were, and had to be cut from the vehicle.
Cheshire Coroner Nicholas Rheinberg said ""none of the young men will have suffered"" as they died.
The Swedish authorities have recommended improvements to the crossing, including LED signs and cameras on the bridge.
In the wake of their deaths, the band's first single Swings & Waterslides reached number 11, while their song Boys That Sing was performed by Coldplay in a tribute at Glastonbury.
Posthumously, Viola Beach scored a number one album in August.
The self-titled debut was compiled by the band's families, using live sessions and studio recordings, many of which were originally bound for an EP.
After the crash, a statement from the families of the band said: ""We are tremendously proud of everything the boys achieved in such a short space of time.

"The new rates will be implemented in October and will benefit a million workers.
Business Secretary Vince Cable said he had accepted a recommendation from the Low Pay Commission that the minimum wage should increase by 3%.
It is the first time in six years that the rise will be higher than inflation.
The rate for 18 to 20-year-olds will go up by 10p to £5.13 an hour, a 2% increase.
The rate for those aged 16 and 17 will rise by 7p to £3.79, also a 2% rise.
Apprentices will earn an extra 5p an hour, taking their wages to at least £2.73.
The consumer prices index (CPI) rate of inflation is currently 1.9%.
""The recommendations I have accepted today mean that low-paid workers will enjoy the biggest cash increase in their take-home pay since 2008,"" said Mr Cable.
He also suggested that all companies should consider helping their staff to share in the fruits of an improving economy.
""I urge businesses to consider how all their staff - not just those on the minimum wage - can enjoy the benefits of recovery,"" he said.
Meanwhile, the man who set up the minimum wage 15 years ago, said it is in need of major reform.
Professor Sir George Bain, founding chair of the Low Pay Commission, said the benchmark was a ""child of its times"" when launched in 1999.
But speaking to BBC Newsnight on Wednesday, he said it had become a ""blunt instrument"" and that many employers could now afford to pay their workers much more.
""If you set it at the 'living wage', which is about £7.65 an hour, you would cause massive unemployment in areas like retail and social care,"" Sir George added.
""But there's only about five sectors where this is true. There's a whole range of sectors where you could easily afford to pay more than the minimum wage.""
Sir George, who has chaired a review of the minimum wage for think-tank the Resolution Foundation, also said there should be a ""special case for London to have a higher national minimum"".
His report also recommends that the Low Pay Commission give longer-term forecasts for the benchmark, to help employers plan for the future.
The latest rise means the national minimum wage is still well below the definition of low pay, as set by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).
This equates to two-thirds of the median full-time hourly wage - about £7.71 an hour. About five million UK workers currently earn below that level.
The latest figure is also well below the living wage, which is £8.80 per hour in London, and £7.65 in the rest of the country.
""Across the country, people are struggling to make ends meet,"" said Dave Prentice, the head of the Unison trade union.
""The sooner we move to a living wage, the better,"" he said.
In January this year, Chancellor George Osborne said he backed the idea of the national minimum wage reaching £7 an hour by October 2015.
The latest announcement could pave the way for that to happen, but it would need a rise of more than 7% next year to do so.
Unite, the country's biggest trade union, said the rise announced was ""timid"".
""To make matters even worse, George Osborne cruelly held out hope that the rate would rise to £7,"" said Len McCluskey, Unite's general secretary.
""The government claims it is on the side of working people but companies are sitting on a cash mountain of £500bn and they should be forced to share more of it with the lowest paid,"" he added.","The national minimum wage will increase by 19p an hour to £6.50, the government has announced.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But with the lowest turnout in the constituency's history and a margin of 2,620 the narrowest ever recorded in this once proud Labour heartland, can this declaration really be believed?
It's a bright and windy day in Stoke-on-Trent.
The town has been at the centre of the political spotlight for weeks now, but people seem more interested in discussing the aftermath of Storm Doris than the small matter of Stoke Central's by-election result.
This staunch working class community was once passionately behind Labour.
In 1951, more than 60,000 went to the polls - 34,260 backing Labour.
Rather than feel victorious about Gareth Snell's win, Labour voters willing to talk simply seem relieved Paul Nuttall didn't clinch it.
In all, 7,853 voted for Mr Snell, compared to 5,233 who wanted UKIP to win.
Wendy Wright, 51, from Newcastle-under-Lyme, thought the vote for UKIP may have been higher had it not been for its disastrous campaign.
""I'm not surprised Labour won because of the way UKIP handled the campaign,"" she said.
""The people of Stoke seemed to think he [Paul Nuttall] didn't come from the area and they didn't believe his pack of lies.
""It's a relief UKIP didn't get in but [Labour retaining the seat] just means things are going to stay the same.""
Ms Wright said there had not been a high turnout because ""people aren't interested in politics"".
She said: ""They've kind of lost faith and lost hope. They think, what's the point, nothing's going to change.
""It's a deprived area and it's a shame because the people are so welcoming and friendly.""
Veronica Millington, 71, from Blythe Bridge, said she and husband Anthony, 75, were ""Labour through and through"".
They backed Mr Snell in the by-election and also voted to stay in the European Union.
""I think the people of Stoke do care about politics and they want to make things better,"" she said.
""I think they were misled by UKIP in the beginning. They seemed to promise them so much and people saw it as a new chance really.
""It was only when all the lies came out they saw how many wrong things had been said.""
Mr Millington, 75, expressed concern about why so few people bothered to go to the polls.
""The turnout seemed to be very low and I think a lot of people think it was a foregone conclusion.
""They thought the Labour Party would win. Now whether or not they've had a jolt from the outsider now, I don't know.""
For a city that has had such a strong relationship with the Labour party, the changing political landscape over the past seven decades reveals a lot about the strength of feeling in the community.
Labour has won all 18 elections since since the inception of the Stoke Central constituency, with the Conservatives coming second until 2001.
But although Labour enjoyed a heyday in the 1960s and 70s, their share of the vote has consistently fallen over the years down to a record low of 37% in this by-election.
So why did this city of proud, working class voters fall out of love with Labour?
""Things started to change because of a growing alienation of the people of Stoke-on-Trent from Westminster,"" says Prof Mick Temple from Staffordshire University.
""Industry was decimated in the 1980s - coal, steel and the Potteries.
""When I first came here [in the early 90s] infrastructure was poor, schools were poor and still today, unemployment is higher than the national average.""
From the closure of Shelton Steel Works - where 10,000 once worked - to the shrinking of its famous pottery industry, the people of Stoke-on-Trent have lived through some turbulent times.
But the bleak images of derelict factories and houses often shown by the media are not a true reflection of the passion and pride of a community that is fiercely proud of its heritage.
Data shows 6.2% of adults in Stoke Central claim unemployment benefit, far higher than the national average of 3.8%.
In recent years employers such as Bet365, Michelin Tyres and Goodwin have invested millions of pounds into their businesses, providing jobs for thousands of people.
Hanley's famous pottery industry is also enjoying something of a resurgence, with Emma Bridgewater investing more than Â£1m in its thriving ceramics factory.
Middleport Pottery, home of world-famous Burleigh, is in the national spotlight thanks to the success of BBC Two's The Great Pottery Throw Down.
Millions of pounds are being spent regenerating the city.
For many people though, the investment has been too little, too late.
""The feeling is that the city has been passed by Westminster and the EU, and that is why people voted Leave so overwhelmingly,"" says Prof Temple.
""There are many towns in the north of England where people feel the same - areas that are ripe for UKIP.""
From 2005, the BNP and UKIP began to resonate with voters, coming fourth and fifth in that year's election and again in 2010.
By 2015, UKIP had won so much support its candidate Mick Harold came second to Tristram Hunt for a seat that had the lowest voter turnout in the whole of the UK.
Pub owner Tony Flackett, 69, backed Paul Nuttall in Thursday's poll.
""It feels sad, it's such a shame, they've worked really hard and people have come from all over the country.
""I've always voted for Conservatives but the last two years I voted UKIP because of Brexit and immigration.
""But life goes on and at least they reduced the margin.""
Tom Wilson, 26, voted for UKIP in the by-election and said he was ""very upset"" at the result.
""I think Labour winning is very bad news for Stoke-on-Trent.
""There has been years of neglect in Stoke with money spent only on Hanley.
""I think only UKIP would have made a change for the people of Stoke.""
UKIP has made moves to appeal to former Labour voters, as well as those who formerly backed the Tories.
""They're more pro-State, pro-NHS. They recognise that strong nationalistic message supported by the working class,"" says Prof Temple.
Between the 2001 and 2011 Censuses, the non-white population doubled and there was a relatively high population of Muslims, he said.
""I'm not saying the response was a racist one - Stoke-on-Trent was getting less and less money from the government and the EU and the feeling was the traditional working class community was being overtaken.
""Many working class voters felt they could not express their views within the Labour party.
""The BNP and UKIP gave them a chance to say how they felt.""
Now Mr Snell is the town's new MP, the challenge is on for him to win back the trust of former Labour supporters and engage with new ones.
Lee Woolrich, 33, from Stoke-on-Trent, is head of client services for a digital agency but did not vote in the by-election.
""I'm ashamed really that I didn't use my vote, but I almost don't think I invest enough in politics to make an informed decision,"" he said.
""I don't think young people are engaged in politics. I think they are more so recently because of what's happened in America.
""I read about Paul Nuttall and some of his views and policies and I don't believe it's what we need here.""
Mr Woolrich believes politicians need to take more of an interest in Stoke-on-Trent - he too feels the place has been forgotten and is badly represented by the media.
""Stoke is doing great without those kinds of ideas.
""I love the developments in Hanley and the cultural quarter.
""Stoke is showing signs of change and getting in line with cities like Manchester.
""On a local level, I like the direction things are going in but I don't necessarily think government in London will listen to the people of Stoke.
""I hate that stigma that Stoke isn't a nice place to live.
""It doesn't do the place justice. It's a beautiful city steeped in history.""
And Prof Temple agrees. ""It's a much more attractive place,"" he said.
""I've been here for 24 years, I've lived all around the world and this is the friendliest, most coherent community I've ever known.
""Stoke-on-Trent has an identity most places in the UK have lost.
""There's a very strong sense of community. It's a place where friendship and family is still strong.""","In the wake of his victory, Stoke Central's new Labour MP Gareth Snell claimed it had been a triumph for the ""politics of hope"".",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

""It's always a tough position as a kind of interim manager, especially with the way things have gone,"" on-loan Bournemouth midfielder Hyndman added.
""But I credit him for coming in and establishing what he wants us to do. I think the boys got behind him quite well.
""The results didn't really show what he was doing and how good he was but it was nice to give him that positive feeling on Wednesday night.""

"A report by technology news site Gizmodo said staff responsible for what was shown to Facebook's 1.6bn users frequently chose to bury articles they did not agree with.
Responding to the allegations, the network's head of search Tom Stocky wrote that the site ""found no evidence that the anonymous allegations are true"".
The claims come weeks after Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg publicly denounced the policies of likely US presidential nominee, Donald Trump.
""I hear fearful voices calling for building walls and distancing people they label as 'others.',"" the 31-year-old said at his firm's recent developers conference.
However, Facebook insisted Mr Zuckerberg's view did not influence what stories are given added visibility on the network.
The Trending Topics column appears in the top right corner of a typical Facebook page. It is designed to highlight what subjects are being discussed heavily by Facebook users around the world.
Facebook explained in a statement that this list was edited by humans so as to avoid regularly recurring popular topics - such as ""lunch"".
Facebook's Mr Stocky explained: ""Popular topics are first surfaced by an algorithm, then audited by review team members to confirm that the topics are in fact trending news in the real world and not, for example, similar-sounding topics or misnomers.""
The Gizmodo story, which quoted a person it said they had been one of the editors, alleged Facebook staff were routinely tampering with Trending Topic stories.
Gizmodo's source added that staff were told to seek out stories published on the BBC, CNN and other mainstream sites ahead of publications with a clearly stated political bias - even if the stories originated on those smaller outlets.
Also, if several mainstream media sites were covering the same story, Facebook would - according to the source - artificially place it in the Trending Topic column, even if it was not being discussed heavily by users.
Breitbart, one of the leading conservative news sources in the US, said the reports confirmed what they had ""long suspected"", that ""Facebook's trending news artificially mutes conservatives and amplifies progressives"".
The anonymous source also claimed that stories staff favoured - such as the Black Lives Matter movement - were given artificially greater prominence. Facebook said that this was ""untrue"".
After a day of growing reports across social media and in conservative-leaning publications, Facebook's Mr Stocky posted a response on his profile.
""We have in place strict guidelines for our trending topic reviewers as they audit topics surfaced algorithmically,"" he wrote.
""Reviewers are required to accept topics that reflect real world events, and are instructed to disregard junk or duplicate topics, hoaxes, or subjects with insufficient sources.
""Facebook does not allow or advise our reviewers to systematically discriminate against sources of any ideological origin and we've designed our tools to make that technically not feasible.
""At the same time, our reviewers' actions are logged and reviewed, and violating our guidelines is a fireable offense.""

"Speaking during a live link-up with a primary school in London, he also said he was ""immensely proud"" to be wearing the Union Flag.
Major Peake added that he was now into the final phase of training, in which he was focusing on the essentials.
He said astronaut training had been rigorous and involved retaining immense quantities of information.
Tim Peake is the first Briton to be selected as an astronaut for the European Space Agency, through a route backed by the UK government.
He was in Houston, Texas, when he spoke live to schoolchildren at Queen's Park Primary School in West London. The event was organised as part of a UK Space Agency programme called Esero, which is designed to use space to help enhance science education.
""I'm immensely proud to be British and to be serving in the European Space Agency,"" he told BBC News.
""It's always very apparent to me, wherever I'm travelling, whether it be Houston, here, or Russia, that you're wearing the flag and you're representing your country.""

"It means BP will have to make the payments that stem from the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig.
BP argued that the deal meant it could fall prey to inflated or bogus compensation claims.
BP agreed to the compensation deal in 2012, but argues it has been misinterpreted.
Shares in BP fell 1.7% in London on Monday.
BP asked the Supreme Court to consider whether people and businesses seeking payments under the settlement included individuals who had not actually suffered any injury as a result of the oil spill.
The Supreme Court's rejection of this appeal by BP is the latest in a series of setbacks for the oil firm.
BP is trying to limit payments over the environmental disaster, which claimed the lives of 11 people and became the largest US offshore oil spill in history.
The settlement agreement has no cap, but BP initially estimated that it would pay roughly $7.8bn (Â£6.1bn) to compensate victims.
It now says it can no longer give a reliable estimate for how much the deal will cost.
BP has already paid out $2.3bn in so-called business economic loss claims out of a total of $4.25bn in compensation claims to individuals and businesses, according to Patrick Juneau, the administrator appointed by the courts to handle claims.
The settlement process is also separate from other court proceedings relating to the spill, including environmental and criminal penalties.
BP has set aside $43bn to resolve all claims.
In September, a US judge ruled BP was ""grossly negligent"" in the lead-up to the 2010 oil spill.

"HS2 Ltd is overseeing the expansion of Euston to cater for passengers using the first phase of the new rail line between London and the Midlands.
The revamp was originally scheduled to end in 2026 but the firm now says it will finish in 2033.
Camden Council has warned the extended works will ""blight"" the area, but HS2 says it will be ""easier to manage"".
The station is set to gain six new platforms and an additional concourse, with building works due to start in 2017.
In a change to plans submitted two years ago, HS2 Ltd has proposed the construction of five further platforms within the existing station should be delayed.
They would be ready for phase two of HS2 which will run from the capital to Leeds and Manchester in 2033.
Rupert Walker, Euston development director of HS2 Ltd, said: ""It is more construction over a longer period but it's less intense. It will be easier for us to manage.""
The impact of building all 11 platforms in one go would have caused a reduction in the capacity of trains using Euston every day, he said.
Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said the changes would ""dramatically improve the design"" of the station.
Sarah Hayward, leader of Camden Council, predicted: ""HS2 will cause decades of blight in the Euston area - to property prices, to our small business' trade and to our residents' lives.""
She said the council is ""ardently opposed to the scheme"", adding it could only be a success with ""close collaboration"" between the local authority, residents and businesses.
HS2 Ltd's new plan will be submitted to Parliament next week in order to form part of the legislation which will allow phase one of High Speed 2 to go ahead.

"Mr Miliband called the prime minister's refusal to take part unless the Green Party was involved a ""pathetic excuse"".
He said he would debate with ""anyone invited by the broadcasters"".
But Mr Cameron said the Labour leader was ""chickening"" out of facing the Greens and all ""national parties"" must be represented.
The exchanges came after Mr Miliband, Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg and UKIP leader Nigel Farage urged broadcasters to press ahead with televised debates before the 7 May poll even if Mr Cameron refuses to take part.
The three leaders have written to Mr Cameron saying it would be ""unacceptable"" for the prime minister to refuse to appear, saying an empty podium should be provided in his absence.
In response, the BBC, Sky News, ITV and Channel 4 said they ""remain committed"" to staging debates before the poll on 7 May.
Raising the issue in Parliament, Mr Miliband said Mr Cameron had argued back in 2010 that it would be ""feeble"" for any party leader to walk away from the debates but was now threatening to do just that.
A high stakes poker game in which the ultimate prize is power - that is what the row about TV leaders election debate has now become.
The players at the table are not just the nation's party leaders but also the bosses of the country's biggest broadcasters.
Watching and waiting are highly paid lawyers who know that this may end up being resolve by a judge and not by the court of public opinion.
The question is - will anyone blink before it gets to the court-room?
Read more from Nick
""It is not for him, it is not for me, it is not for any party leader to decide who is in the debate,"" he said. ""It is up to the broadcasters, that is the country we live in.
""I think he does protest too much. He has run out of excuses, he is running scared of these debates and in the words of his heroine Margaret Thatcher 'he is frit'"".
Mr Cameron said Mr Miliband wanted ""to debate having a debate"" because he did not want to talk about the economy and other issues.
He said he was keen to defend his record during the campaign, suggesting he would support the idea of two debates, one a head-to-head encounter between him and Mr Miliband and another in which all ""national parties"" were represented.
""The more time he and I can spend on television and in the television studio, the happier I will be,"" he said.
But Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, who was sitting next to the prime minister, was heard shouting ""excuses, excuses"" as Mr Cameron answered one of Mr Miliband's questions.
In identical letters to Mr Cameron, Mr Miliband, Mr Clegg and Mr Farage called for a repeat of the 2010 debates - the first ever leaders' TV debates in a British election - and insisted they ""not the property of the politicians"".
They wrote: ""I believe it would be a major setback to our democratic processes if these debates were not repeated in 2015 because of one politician's unwillingness to participate.""
The added: ""Therefore, if you are unwilling to reconsider, the three party leaders who have committed to participate will ask the broadcasters to press ahead with the debates and provide an empty podium should you have a last-minute change of heart.""
Under plans put forward by the BBC, Sky News, ITV and Channel 4 in October, the pre-election live TV debates would include the Conservatives, Labour, Liberal Democrats and UKIP.
Mr Cameron would take on Labour leader Mr Miliband head-to-head in one debate, another would feature Mr Cameron, Mr Miliband and Lib Dem leader Mr Clegg, and a third would also include UKIP's Mr Farage.
The suggested schedule is for debates on 2 April, 16 April and 30 April, ahead of the general election on 7 May.
Mr Farage said the BBC would be ""within its rights"", under the terms of its editorial guidelines, to stage a debate without Mr Cameron and providing an empty podium would be ""entirely appropriate"".
""If David Cameron chooses not to turn up that is his hard luck,"" he told the BBC News Channel. ""My guess is that if the broadcasters hold firm, Mr Cameron will buckle and say yes.""
Lord Ashdown, who is leading the Lib Dems' general election campaign, urged broadcasters to ""stick to their guns"" or else he feared the impetus for the debates would ""ebb away"".
He told Sky News: ""You just can't let the prime minister or anybody else basically hold the country and our democracy to ransom by saying no.""
But Green Party leader Natalie Bennett said she backed Mr Cameron's stance and said it was in the interest of the three other leaders to help persuade broadcasters that her party should be included in one of the debates.
Ms Bennett said ITV had not yet made a final decision and she hoped to hold talks with the broadcaster in the near future.
""Staging the debates without the prime minister might score a point but would not serve the public, who rightly expect the political parties and the broadcasters to find a format that is acceptable to all concerned,"" she wrote in a letter to the trio.
""If you indicated that you were open to the inclusion of the Greens, then I feel sure that ITV would respond.""
John Curtice, professor of politics at the University of Strathclyde, said that having ""nailed his colours to the mast"" over the Green Party's participation, it would be difficult for Mr Cameron to shun the debates if they were invited.
The three debates in 2010 were watched by a total of 22 million people, and they have been cited as one reason for the increase in turnout at the election, which rose for the first time since 1992.
While the debates were a ""good test of political leadership"", Prof Curtice told the BBC that they had dominated the campaign and ""not necessarily succeeded in reaching out to more marginal voters"".
The SNP and Plaid Cymru, which have more seats in Parliament than either UKIP or the Green Party, also say they should be represented in any series of debates.
SNP deputy leader Stuart Hosie said: ""The idea that the SNP, bigger than UKIP and the Lib Dems combined in terms of membership, should be excluded from debates which are broadcast into people's homes in Scotland is just simply quite unacceptable.""
In a statement, the four broadcasters said: ""The debates played an important role in informing millions of our viewers in 2010 and we will continue to work with all the parties to ensure that they happen again in 2015"".

"Prof Higgs, who does not own a mobile phone, said a former neighbour had pulled up in her car as he was returning from lunch in Edinburgh.
He added: ""She congratulated me on the news and I said 'oh, what news?'""
The woman had been alerted by her daughter in London that Prof Higgs had won the award, he revealed.
He added: ""I heard more about it obviously when I got home and started reading the messages.""
The 84-year-old emeritus professor at the University of Edinburgh was recognised by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences for his work on the theory of the particle which shares his name, the Higgs boson.
He shares this year's physics prize with Francois Englert of Belgium, and joins the ranks of past Nobel winners including Marie Curie and Albert Einstein.
The existence of the so-called ""God particle"", said to give matter its substance, or mass, was proved almost 50 years later by a team from the European nuclear research facility (Cern) and its Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in Geneva, Switzerland.
Speaking for the first time about the award at a media conference at the University of Edinburgh, he said: ""How do I feel? Well, obviously I'm delighted and rather relieved in a sense that it's all over. It has been a long time coming.""
An old friend told him he had been nominated as far back as 1980, he said.
Prof Higgs added: ""In terms of later events, it seemed to me for many years that the experimental verification might not come in my lifetime.
""But since the start up of the LHC it has been pretty clear that they would get there, and despite some mishaps they did get there"".
Stressing the involvement of other theorists and Cern, he added: ""I think clearly they should, but it is going to be even more difficult for the Nobel Committee to allocate the credit when it comes to an organisation like Cern.
""I should remind you that although only two of us have shared this prize, Francois Englert of Brussels and myself, that the work in 1964 involved three groups of people, (including) two in Brussels.
""Unfortunately Robert Brout died a few years ago so is no longer able to be awarded the prize, but he would certainly have been one of the winners if he had still been alive.
""But there were three others who also contributed and it is already difficult to allocate the credit amongst the theorists.
""Although a lot of people seem to think I did all this single-handed, it was actually part of a theoretical programme which had been started in 1960.""
Prof Higgs was born in Newcastle, but developed his theory while working at the University of Edinburgh.
The landmark research that defined what was to become known as the Higgs boson was published in 1964.
Discovering the particle became one of the most sought-after goals in science, and the team of scientists behind the $10bn LHC at Cern made proving its existence a key priority.
In July of last year, physicists at Cern confirmed the discovery of a particle consistent with the Higgs boson.
Prof Higgs, who had often been uncomfortable with the attention his theory brought, was in Geneva to hear the news, and wiped a tear from his eye as the announcement was made.
Reacting to the discovery at the time, he told reporters: ""It's very nice to be right sometimes.""",Nobel Prize-winning scientist Prof Peter Higgs has revealed he did not know he had won the award until a woman congratulated him in the street.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"The papers were presented to a meeting of health board chief executives and civil servants last month.
They suggest the NHS is facing a £400m funding gap, and sweeping changes will be needed for boards to break even.
The Scottish government said it was committed to ""protecting and increasing the NHS budget"".
The papers were passed to the BBC and The Herald by a senior NHS whistleblower, who said they had become frustrated by the argument of the ""Yes"" campaign that the biggest threat to the NHS comes from the UK government.
The documents state: ""The status quo and preservation of existing models of care are no longer an option given the pressing challenges we face.""
The whistleblower has alleged that pressures on the NHS come from Scottish government policies.
The confidential documents relate to a meeting held by NHS bosses on 6 August 2014.
As part of an initiative to transform care by 2020, legislation has been passed by the Scottish government to encourage more community care.
However, the papers say this has been undermined by ""continued commitments"" which are ""directly in conflict"" with the 2020 vision and increase the cost of expensive hospital care.
The documents say new obligations are ""not fully funded"".  The documents conclude that the ""status quo in terms of service and workforce planning is not an option"".
The papers outline a funding gap of £400-£450m in the next two financial years, 2015-17, which is described as ""a level significantly in excess of that previously required"".
The documents suggest that health boards will have to consider centralising hospitals and closing services - a measure which the SNP vowed to stop when it was elected in 2007.
The Scottish government reversed the closure of Accident and Emergency departments at Monklands and Ayr hospitals, but the papers suggest such dramatic measures may be back on the table.
""Radical and urgent decisions need to be made regarding the shape and configuration of services,"" the document states.
But it also points out that boards are ""without the mandate and authority to implement the scale of change and redesign required"".
""We need to commit to these priorities and accept that significant changes require to be implemented,"" the papers conclude.
The whistleblower told the BBC: ""Services are unsustainable right across Scotland from three emergency centres in Lanarkshire, to emergency care at the Vale (of Leven) to paediatrics at St John's (in Livingston), and with particular issues for more rural boards, hence the problems at Grampian.
""The current pattern of services is underpinned but short-term money and fixes won't stack up going into next year.
""There is a complete gap between policy announcements about care in the community and more money for primary care, and the announcements and commitments which continually increase the cost of acute care.""
The Scottish government said the paper was ""part of the regular discussions among NHS leaders to plan for NHS Scotland's future"".
Health Secretary Alex Neil said: ""We've protected Scotland's NHS from the Tories' cuts, and with independence we can ensure that it is never again under threat from Westminster's dangerous obsession with austerity.
""Despite Scotland's budget being slashed by 7.2% by George Osborne between 2010/11 and 2015/16, our increases in health spending means that the NHS is receiving record high funding, with a budget increase of over £1bn between 2010/11 and 2015/16.""
He added: ""To ensure we can continue to develop the NHS, it's important that NHS boards regularly discuss their future plans to inform budget discussions with Scottish government officials, and to identify how we will continue to deliver quality care and treatment.
""We continue to develop our health service to meet the changing demands of the people of Scotland, and that's why we've already legislated to integrate health and social care from April next year.
""This integration of services is particularly important to ensure our elderly population is kept well and provided with care in the best setting for their wellbeing.""",Confidential papers passed to the BBC suggest a radical cost-saving plan will be implemented in the Scottish NHS after the referendum.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rebels have now lost more than 90% of the territory they once held in eastern Aleppo since government forces stepped up their offensive to regain full control of the city a month ago.
Russia, which backs the government, says more than 100,000 civilians have been displaced by the fighting and that 2,200 rebel fighters have surrendered.
Aleppo was once Syria's largest city, and its commercial and industrial hub before the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad began in 2011.
For much of the past four years it has been divided roughly in two, with the government controlling the western half and rebels the east.
Troops finally broke the deadlock with the help of Iranian-backed militias and Russian air strikes, reinstating a siege on the east in early September and launching an all-out assault weeks later.
On Monday morning, the official Sana news agency cited a military source as saying that the army had taken full control of the key southern district of Sheikh Saeed, as well as the neighbouring areas of Karam al-Daadaa and Saliheen.
Hours later, nearby Bustan al-Qasr, Kallasa, Fardous, Jaloun and Jisr al-Haj had also fallen after rebel fighters withdrew in the face of an intense government bombardment, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported.
Late on Monday the monitoring group said that clashes were continuing in Salah al-Din neighbourhood and other areas remaining under rebel control.
In an interview with the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme, an English teacher who is still inside a rebel-held area described the conditions as terrible.
""The situation inside the eastern part of Aleppo is literally doomsday,"" Abdul Kafi Alhamado said. ""Bombs are everywhere, people are running, people are injured in the streets, no-one can dare go to help them, some people are under the rubble.""
The Syrian Observatory says that at least 415 civilians and 364 rebel fighters have been killed in rebel-held areas since 15 November. Another 130 civilians have died in rebel rocket and mortar attacks on the government-controlled west.
Russia and the United States, which backs the rebels, held talks in Geneva over the weekend to discuss a deal for civilians and rebel fighters to leave Aleppo.
But on Monday, US officials said their Russian counterparts had rejected a proposal for an immediate cessation of hostilities to allow for safe departures.
Analysts say the fall of Aleppo would be a big blow to the opposition, as it would leave the government in control of Syria's four largest cities.
However, the head of the umbrella group that represented political and armed opposition factions at failed peace talks at the start of this year insisted that their determination to overthrow the president would not be diminished.
""If Assad and his allies think that a military advance in certain quarters of Aleppo will signify that we will make concessions, then [I say] that will not happen,"" Riyad Hijab, general co-ordinator of the High Negotiations Committee, told reporters.
As fighting intensified for the last rebel-held neighbourhoods, there have been frantic efforts to secure guarantees to evacuate the most vulnerable - the very ill, gravely injured and innocent children. All efforts have been in vain.
""It's a far dream,"" one frustrated aid official told me on Monday, about a long-standing request for a UN-organised medical mission for about 500 patients and their families.
Two efforts, which seemed close to agreement, collapsed last week when Russia asserted there was no need for a ceasefire since tens of thousands were escaping without one.  Sources say Russia then shifted its stance. But rebel groups demanded a ceasefire and a delivery of aid first.
In desperation, aid agencies reduced their request from 72 hours to just three. A group known as ""Doctors Under Fire"" has also been pleading for the evacuation of hundreds of children.
British surgeon Dr David Nott says ""we only need a temporary cessation of 60 minutes to save them all."" Even that seems to have been too much.","Syria's army says the battle for Aleppo is in its final phase, after major gains by troops in the city's south left rebels on the brink of defeat.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The federation represents thousands of rank and file PSNI officers.
Its chairman, Mark Lindsay, has said confidence in the office of the ombudsman is at an all-time low.
A spokesperson for the ombudsman said the comments were ""disappointing"" and ""at odds with the feedback from police officers who had been investigated"".
Mr Lindsay told the federation's annual conference that ""reform is not so much desirable as essential"".
He also said the PSNI is in a state of crisis because of reducing budgets and officer numbers.
Criticism of the office of the ombudsman by the federation is not new.
In his speech on Wednesday, Mr Lindsay said the federation accepted the need for the independent investigation of complaints against police officers.
But, with Ombudsman Dr Michael Maguire among the audience at the La Mon House Hotel, he suggested some feel they are victims of a ""witch hunt"".
""It gives me no pleasure to say that, unfortunately, there is very little officer confidence in relation to the operation of the ombudsman's office,"" he said.
""The credibility of the office is also seriously questioned.""
The federation chairman highlighted the ongoing PSNI investigation into the theft and unlawful disclosure of documents from the ombudsman's office.
He also cited the discovery of a gun and ammunition in a filing cabinet belonging to a member of staff in the office last year.
""There is an obvious need for an independent avenue of appeal, whereby officers will have meaningful redress against malicious and inept investigations,"" he said.
""The ombudsman is with us today and I say to him that this isn't about you, but rather the legislative architecture of the system you preside over.
""If your office conducts itself with the high standards you demand of police officers, then surely you have nothing to fear from such accountability.""
Mr Lindsay said the level of assaults against police officers by members of the public is ""unacceptably high"" and called for tougher action to protect them.
He told the conference that eight out of 10 PSNI officers who responded to a survey said they had been victims of a physical or verbal assault during the past year.
It's understood that 14% of PSNI officers took part in the survey.
The federation has called for the introduction of ""spitguards"" to prevent people in custody spitting at officers.
He also warned of ""dire consequences"" for the PSNI because of reducing budgets and officer numbers.
""We're now beyond the point of warning of a crisis. Right now, we're in the middle of a crisis,"" Mr Lindsay said.
""What's needed now is for our politicians from all sides to make a stand against this madness of continuing austerity.
""They must make policing one of their main priorities and campaign as never before to get the government to re-think its disastrous policy.""",The Police Federation has called for an independent appeals process to allow challenges to investigations reports by the Police Ombudsman.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Rocky Taylor, a friend of 40 years standing, said the former BBC radio DJ and Crackerjack presenter had died in hospital in Bournemouth.
Stewart's former brother-in-law, Adriano Henney, tweeted to say ""Fun guy-Huge loss"".
Director of BBC Music Bob Shennan said Stewart had been a ""stalwart"" of popular music broadcasting.
Mr Shennan said Stewart's shows had been enjoyed by millions of listeners.
Ed 'Stewpot' Stewart: Your memories
Stewart's BBC Radio 2 colleagues were extremely saddened, he said, adding: ""We are thinking of Ed's friends and family at this difficult time.""
Stewart's fellow DJ from his early days on pirate radio, Tony Blackburn, who also went on to Radio 1, said Stewart would be missed.
""A lovely guy, loved his golf and he loved playing the songs on Junior Choice.
""I think he'll probably be best remembered for Junior Choice because he did that programme, I think, particularly well.
""He was very, very good at that, and of course, on television.""
His former colleague and friend of 50 years, BBC DJ David Hamilton, said Stewart ""was a little bit like a good wine; he just got better as time went on"".
The DJ, also known by the nickname ""Diddy"", said he spoke to his old friend just a few days ago.
He said: ""We used to play football together in the showbiz football team, we even once rode in a speedway race together at Wembley Stadium, so we've done a lot of things together.
""He was a really good guy, Ed, and I really will miss him.""
His younger sister, Sue Mainwaring, 69, described him as hardworking, loyal and ""such a good brother"".
""We had such fun. When he was on the pirates [radio stations] he had two weeks on and one week off - of which every weekend he'd invite everybody back for jazz sessions. Celebs used to come along, including Kenny Everett, David Hamilton, Tony Brandon. He loved jazz. He loved music.""
She said she had spent Christmas and New Year with him and other members of the family.
Devon-born Stewart's broadcasting career spanned more than 50 years. He started out as an announcer, film critic and rugby reporter with Radio Hong Kong.
In an interview with the Express newspaper in 2014, he said he had returned to England five years later and joined pirate radio ship Radio London, based four miles off shore.
He was one of the first presenters on Radio 1 when it launched in 1967, and went on to become a regular Top of the Pops presenter in the 1970s.
He was a regular Radio 2 presenter for 15 years, and during that time broadcast from the summits of Ben Nevis and Snowdon, Mount Vesuvius volcano in Italy, and also live from the Falkland Islands.
On television, Stewart was best known for children's favourite Crackerjack. He hosted the show from 1973 to 1979.
He was also a longstanding presenter of children's show Junior Choice, which last broadcast on BBC Radio 2 over Christmas.
On it he coined his trademark catchphrase: '''Ello darling.""
In his sign-off at the end of his final programme, he thanked listeners, saying: ""I'll be with you whenever, but have a great Christmas Day, won't you, folks?""
Off air, he was a keen golfer and dedicated Everton FC fan.
On Twitter, TV presenter Noel Edmonds left heartfelt messages about the man he called his ""mentor"".
Edmonds joined BBC Radio 1 in 1969, taking over from the sacked Kenny Everett in 1970. At 21, he was the station's youngest DJ at the time.
""In '67 Ed Stewart heard a DJ audition tape, liked it, passed it to Kenny Everett and my career was born. Stewpot I owe you everything xN,"" he tweeted.
Former Radio 1 DJ and current Radio 2 broadcaster Simon Mayo wrote in a tweet: ""How sad to hear of the passing of Ed Stewart.  Junior Choice was always a radio classic"".
Celebrity astrologer Russell Grant tweeted: ""So sad to hear an old DJ colleague of mine Ed Stewart 'Stewpot' has passed over.
""I last worked with him on Radio Mercury. Happy memories.""
Coronation Street actor Les Dennis posted: ""Sad to hear Ed ""Stewpot"" Stewart has died. A great broadcaster and a nice man.""

"The phrase ""rapid rise through the ranks"" is a standard line in profiles of political leaders. But it's rarely as speedy as in Natalie Bennett's case.
The Australian-born former Guardian journalist woke up on New Year's Day 2006 and decided she wanted to do something to change the world.
After pondering her options (should she get involved with an NGO or the UN?) she joined the Green Party. Within six short years she had become its leader.
Three years after that she was sharing a stage with the prime minister and other party leaders in a televised general election debate.
Her sudden arrival on the frontline of British politics was all the more remarkable because she had never won an election, other than the one that had made her party leader.
Her first aim when she took on the job was to insert the Green Party - routinely ignored or patronised by the mainstream media - into the national conversation.
But when media outlets finally began calling, on the back of a surge in support for the party, she sometimes found it difficult to get her message across in a suitably snappy way.
Her vision for the party was to show how ""economic and environmental justice are indivisible"", she explains, ""the idea that tackling environmental problems isn't an add-on luxury"".
It was ""not a easy concept to get across"", she confesses. ""I still don't think I've got the 12 second soundbite. But I am going to keep working on it.""
""It's a classic Shakespearean thing,"" she says of her struggles with the broadcast media. ""It's both my strength and my weakness that I answer the question.""
But, she adds, ""when you get asked a stupid question, it's rather hard to know what to do at that point. And I guess I get tangled up in my desire to answer a question, even when it's a really stupid question"".
Did she get asked a lot of stupid questions?
""Yes.""
Asked for an example, she ponders for a minute, before highlighting an interview with the BBC's very own John Humphrys, which led to her having ""to spend time, valuable peak time, explaining how the interviewer got the question wrong. And listeners don't particularly like that because it's all technical and boring and you are arguing with the interviewer but if it's entirely on the wrong track you have to"".
She says she has some sympathy with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who has also attracted criticism for broadcast interviews in which he has deviated from the usual prepared soundbites.
""The focus on the individual is a problem for British politics and it's very uncomfortable when the focus is on you,"" she says, arguing that the media in continental Europe are focused more on policies than personalities and trivia.
""I am not complaining - you have to work within those limits,"" she adds, but she believes British politics is ""broken"" and the media must take its share of the blame.
""There should be some pressure on the journalist to ask better, more sensible questions,"" she argues.
There was nothing particularly stupid about the question that prompted her darkest moment in a radio studio, however, when she struggled over several excruciating minutes, punctuated by coughing fits, to answer a question from LBC's Nick Ferrari on her party's housing policy.
She was quick to hold her hands up afterwards, apologising to supporters and blaming her sub-par performance, in the heat of the general election campaign, on ""brain freeze"".
""That was a very tough moment. And of course you take a bit of a punch to the stomach.
""But then a few weeks later I was up on the leader debates, able to look David Cameron in the eye and challenge him about his failure to welcome Syrian refugees to Britain, and that was one of the best moments.
""My great problem on that day was that I was in no way well enough to actually be doing anything. I'd had about three and a half hours sleep and I'd been throwing up most of the night. I should have just pulled the day but that's partly a function of how we got to that point.
""We weren't used to getting a lot of media attention and it was very, very hard to turn media attention down.""
One of Ms Bennett's proudest moments came at the end of the BBC leaders debate when she joined Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood and Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon in a ""group hug"", while Labour leader Ed Miliband looked on awkwardly.
This felt like a watershed moment for women in politics, she says, sending out the message ""that politics can not just be 'dog eat dog', it can be people agreeing on some things and disagreeing on others but supporting each other"".
As a lifelong feminist, she is particularly pleased to have been told by ""lots of young women"" that they had been inspired by the ""group hug"", which she stresses had not been planned in advance.
""I hope and think that that moment really, in 15 years' time, 20 years' time, we might see a whole crop of MPs down the road who will reference that moment as the time they decided they were going to try and get there.""
Ms Bennett's decision to pitch for the anti-austerity vote, positioning the Greens as a left-wing alternative to what was then Ed Miliband's Labour Party, struck a chord with idealistic young people who felt alienated by mainstream politics, and led to a surge in party membership.
But then Jeremy Corbyn came along and shifted Labour firmly to the left, inspiring idealistic activists to join his party in numbers the Greens could only dream about.
Hasn't the Green Party, which had a mixed set of results in May's elections, losing four councillors in England and failing to make progress in Wales but getting its best ever result in London, been crowded out of the picture by Labour?
Ms Bennett insists this is not the case, arguing that there is a ""very clear distinction"" between the Greens and Labour on a range of issues - from nuclear weapons to fracking - and that voters know exactly what they are getting when they vote Green.
But she is also open to the idea of a ""progressive alliance"" at the next general election, with local Green Parties potentially making electoral pacts with Labour, Plaid Cymru, the SNP or other parties who broadly share their outlook.
She remains a passionate advocate of electoral reform. The Green Party fielded a record number of general election candidates in 2015, standing in 93% of constituencies, and gaining more than a million votes. By rights, she argues, the party should have 25 MPs. She believes the case for scrapping what she sees as Britain's outdated first-past-the-post electoral system is gaining ground in the country.
She says she has had an ""amazing"" four years as leader, and has no regrets, believing the party is in better shape now, having quadrupled its membership and gained a foothold in the national debate on issues such as welfare and the economy, than when she took over.
But she is also keen to stress that she will not be leaving politics.
""I'm aiming to turn former leader into a role in its own right, to keep travelling the country, supporting local parties, doing media. Leadership is a role we can share around. It's not you become leader, that's the pinnacle, and then you disappear.""
Asked if she has any advice for the next leader, she says trust the party membership.
Anything else?
""Work out how to answer stupid questions,"" she laughs. ""I still don't quite know the answer to that one myself.""","As the Green Party of England and Wales prepares to unveil a replacement for Natalie Bennett, who is standing down after four years as leader, she reflects on life in the media spotlight - and what she plans to do next.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Ashford Borough Council is owed more than £70,000 and Canterbury City Council is owed almost £45,000 in unpaid fines, BBC South East has found.
More than half of Kent's councils are using a private company to help recover fines issued to foreign drivers.
In Brighton more than three-quarters of fines were unpaid, a Freedom of Information request has found.
Brighton and Hove City Council told BBC South East it had issued 5,402 fines to foreign drivers, with 1,216 paid, and 3,400 remaining unpaid.  The council said it had written off the remaining 746 fines.
Most of those drivers fined in Kent were in tourist destinations in East Kent and near the Channel ports.
A private company called Euro Parking Collection has been hired by eight councils in Kent to work with Vehicle Licensing Authorities to collect some of the outstanding fines.
Illegal parking in the UK is a civil offence so councils cannot request drivers' names and addresses from their home countries.
In France and some other European countries however, illegal parking is a criminal offence dealt with by the police.
Patrick Troy from the British Parking Association said: ""Local authorities don't have the means by which to enforce fines against foreign registered vehicles in the same way the do against UK registered vehicles.

"Chris Coleman's team are likely to face a tough draw as they will be one of the lowest-seeded teams.
But former striker Rush believes the biggest nations will not want to face a Welsh side which lost only once in qualifying.

""I'm not saying we are going to win it but the opposition won't like to play Wales.

"The union wants to take over Newport Gwent Dragons and the ground, hoping to solve the water-logging problems by laying a 4G surface.
But  if County stay up Football League rules do not allow artificial surfaces.
""Ideally we would have wanted to put an artificial pitch down,"" said WRU chief executive, Martyn Phillips.
""We want the ground to be a hub for rugby for women and girls and kids and get it played on all day, every day.
""That is probably not going to be possible now because Newport County need a grass pitch.

"The Mi-8 transporter was brought down by rebels, Russia says, in northern Idlib province.
It was returning from delivering humanitarian aid to the besieged city of Aleppo, the defence ministry said.
It is not clear which group brought the helicopter down.
An alliance of forces, including hardline jihadist factions, is the dominant power in Idlib.
Jabhat Fateh al-Sham - formerly known as Jabhat al-Nusra - is among those active in the province, and so-called Islamic State has vowed to carry out jihad against Russian forces.
The helicopter was carrying three crew and two officers.
Pictures on social media, purportedly of the latest Russian helicopter downing, showed burning wreckage and bodies, with armed men milling around.
Footage showed at least one body being dragged away. Another is seen apparently being trampled on.
This is the worst single loss of life for Russia since it launched its air offensive in Syria in support of President Assad towards the end of last year.
Moscow says the helicopter was not involved in a military mission, but was delivering humanitarian aid.  Rebel sources appear to confirm this.  It may not have been known to those who shot the helicopter down, as most of Russia's airpower in Syria has been used for military purposes to support pro-government forces.
But it will further inflame feelings in Russia against rebels in Syria.  Moscow has repeatedly said it sees little distinction between the rebels in terms of brutality and extremism.  The graphic images of victims posted online of the aftermath of the incident will add fuel to the fire.
Russia has previously, though seldom, lost aircraft since it launched operations in support of the Syrian government at the end of September 2015.
In July, two Russian pilots were killed when their helicopter was shot down east of the city of Palmyra by so-called Islamic State (IS).
Last November, the pilot of a Russian Su-24 fighter plane was killed when the aircraft was shot down by Turkey on its border with Syria.
A Russian marine sent on a mission to rescue the pilot was also killed when his helicopter was shot down.
Russia is a key backer of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and is supporting pro-government forces with air strikes on rebels.
Government forces cut off rebel-held eastern parts of Aleppo last month.
Russia and Syria announced the opening of what they called humanitarian corridors for civilians and rebels wanting to surrender, but few people are reported to have used them, fearing they would be targeted.

"The Australian Livestock Exporters' Council said the footage, released by animal rights group Animals Australia, was ""horrific"".
Animals Australia said it had been filmed inside the two abattoirs approved to process Australian cattle.
Exports to Egypt were halted in 2006 for four years over similar concerns.
And in 2011, livestock exports to Indonesia were suspended after evidence of cruelty emerged there.
The Egyptian videos have not been made public, but Animals Australia said they showed cattle believed to have come from Australia being treated in a ""vicious, cruel and clumsy"" way.
The group is campaigning for a full ban on livestock exports.
""The way that these animals are treated are quite horrific,"" said spokeswoman Glenys Oogjes.
In one instance, a cow fell off the processing line and was chased through the abattoir before having its legs cut and being stabbed to death, she said.
""It is quite terrible and it shows systemic problems in these abattoirs for our animals. And how Australia ever sent animals back there after a suspension in 2006 is beyond us.""
The chief executive of the Livestock Exporters' Council, Alison Penfold, said the acts shown in the footage were ""exceptionally distressing"" and ""completely unacceptable to the industry and to Australians"".
She told the BBC the trade was undertaken under a memorandum of understanding between the Australian and the Egyptian governments.
The industry was investigating, she said, and working with the Egyptian authorities to ensure the welfare of animals already at the facilities.
Australia's Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry said in a statement it was ""pleased with the level of co-operation"" from the Egyptian authorities.
Australia exports more than 700,000 cattle each year, and the industry is worth about A$1bn ($1.03bn: Â£0.7bn) a year.
But pressure is growing for a total ban on live exports amid a series of cruelty scandals.
Agriculture Minister Joe Ludwig said he backed the industry's voluntary suspension.

Despite the Super League leaders looking set to be overturned by second-placed Warrington, Radford's side came from behind to grab a late 12-10 win.
""That's the togetherness we have in this team,"" he told BBC Sport.
""We have the ingredients there to go on from this. We have the foundations in place to go and achieve more.""
Hull, who have already qualified for the Super League play-off semi-finals, still have to host both Warrington and third-placed Wigan, as well as visiting fourth-placed St Helens before determining who might line up at Old Trafford for the Grand Final on 8 October.
Radford added: ""There's the League Leaders' Shield to still play for and then we could be only 80 minutes away from a Grand Final.""
The same two goals are also still very much in the sights of Tony Smith's Warrington.
""It will go down as one of the better finals for many a year,"" said the Wire boss, after his club suffered their first defeat at the rebuilt Wembley and missed out on a fourth Challenge Cup victory in eight seasons.
""We'll go away and lick our wounds, but we won't sulk for too long. We're a proud club and we've still got a great opportunity to win two other trophies.""
Even in a sport that is full of ups and downs in so many contests, it is an impressive statistic that Saturday's final was the 14th time that Hull have come from behind to win this season.
""It's history-making for us and we should feel rightly proud,"" said Radford. ""There's been a lot of past Hull teams with some tremendous players who have not achieved what we have.
""And it was great for Jamie Shaul to get the winning try. He's a local lad like me, so he gets a lot of stick when we lose. But he can now go and walk his dog with pride.""
Modest Hull scrum-half Marc Sneyd played down his own contribution to Hull FC's late rally after being named man of the match.
""I was surprised I'd won,"" he said, suggesting that he was expecting hooker Danny Houghton to pick up the Lance Todd Trophy.
His coach Radford also had praise for Houghton, who made a try-saving tackle on Ben Currie with two minute remaining, adding: ""He would not look out of place in the England team.""

But Hull skipper Gareth Ellis, finally successful in his third final, insisted that Sneyd fully deserved his individual accolade.
""Don't let him kid you he was not a worthy winner of the Lance Todd,"" Ellis said. ""It was a hot, sapping day and when he put that 40-20 in (before Mahe Fonua's try) you could see some Warrington heads drop.
""Warrington were the better team for 60 minutes, but Marc has been quality with his kicking all season and he produced it when it mattered.

"In-form striker James Vaughan gave the hosts a 22nd-minute lead before Reece Brown scored a 45th-minute free-kick from around 40 yards.
Bury were stunned by three goals in eight minutes through Erhun Oztumer and a Jason McCarthy brace, but Tom Soares pounced at the death to deny Walsall a third straight win.
Tom Pope and Amadou Bakayoko had gone close at each end before Pope crossed for Vaughan to slide in his 17th goal of the season - and seventh in three games.
Neil Etheridge then saved a Pope header and blocked the striker's follow-up, while Bury's Rob Lainton saved a Bakayoko shot.
But Bury doubled their lead as Brown's free-kick caught Etheridge off his line and flew into the top corner.
The Shakers eased off in the second half, though, and Walsall made them pay. Matt Preston had a shot blocked on the line and Lainton denied Isaiah Osbourne from the rebound.
But Oztumer hit a 20-yard free-kick into the bottom corner on 71 minutes to spark the Saddlers' fightback.
Five minutes later, McCarthy fired home from Bakayoko's cut-back before the Southampton loanee headed home from Osbourne's cross.
Soares then glanced in Brown's cross to rescue a point but Bury remain in the relegation zone.

"Some 60 excavators and 100 dump trucks are being used in the search. The boy fell down the 40m dry well in Baoding, Hebei province on Sunday morning.
He had been helping harvest vegetables, his father told Chinese media. The child's condition is unknown.
Oxygen, food and water have been supplied. The 30cm-diameter well is too narrow for an adult to retrieve him.
After two days of careful digging, rescuers have dug only 13m down the metal shaft, which threatens to collapse at any moment.
An 800-square metre work area has been cleared to facilitate rescue attempts, a volunteer told The Paper, a Shanghai-based news website.
The well had been left unused for five years and there were no warning signs. Visual imagery has so far failed to locate the boy.
Many locals volunteered to help in the rescue, rushing to the scene after learning about the accident on WeChat, a popular communication app in China.
Most netizens sent good wishes to the boy.
""It was saddening to read about such news. As a mother, it was heartbreaking to see a child fall into a well. I hope the child will be alive and alive,"" one user called 80 Hou Bu Huai wrote.
Some wondered who was to blame.

"A rugged, mountainous country, with lush valleys to the south and north, it is Central Asia's poorest nation.
Tajiks are the country's largest ethnic group, with Uzbeks making up a quarter of the population, over half of which is employed in agriculture and just one-fifth in industry. A third of Tajikistan's population is under 14 years of age.

The five-year civil war between the Moscow-backed government and the Islamist-led opposition, in which up to 50,000 people were killed and over one-tenth of the population fled the country, ended in 1997 with a United Nations-brokered peace agreement.
Tajikistan's economy has never really recovered from the civil war, and poverty is widespread. Almost half of GDP is earned by migrants working abroad, especially in Russia, but the recession in 2009 threatened that income. The country is also dependent on oil and gas imports.
Economic hardship is seen as a contributing to a renewed interest in Islam - including more radical forms - among young Tajiks.
Tajikistan has been accused by its neighbours of tolerating the presence of training camps for Islamist rebels on its territory, an accusation which it has strongly denied.
Tajikistan has relied heavily on Russian assistance to counter continuing security problems and cope with the dire economic situation. Skirmishes with drug smugglers crossing illegally from Afghanistan occur regularly, as Tajikistan is the first stop on the drugs route from there to Russia and the West.
Russia maintains military garrisons in Tajikistan and in 2004 took back control over a former Soviet space monitoring centre. These developments were widely seen as a sign of Russia's wish to counter increased US influence in Central Asia.
Economic ties with neighbouring China are extensive. China has extended credits and has helped to build roads, tunnels and power infrastructure. Chinese firms are investing in oil and gas exploration and in gold mining.","A former Soviet republic, Tajikistan plunged into civil war almost as soon as it became independent from the Soviet Union in 1991.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"She was 12 at the time and living with her parents and two siblings in northern Peru.
On that night, two officials came to their home and took away her father.
Mr Katsura, who owned a small general store, was arrested because he was part of Peru's prosperous Japanese community.
""My father told them he hadn't done anything wrong, but they didn't listen to him,"" she recalls.
Japanese people began migrating to Peru in considerable numbers at the end of the 19th Century, drawn by opportunities to work in the mines and on sugar plantations.
By the 1940s, an estimated 25,000 people of Japanese descent lived in Peru. Many had become lawyers and doctors, or owned small businesses.
Their prosperity, further fuelled by racism, soon triggered anti-Japanese sentiment in Peru, Stephanie Moore explains.
Ms Moore, a scholar at the Japanese Peruvian Oral History Project, says after the outbreak of World War Two, the Japanese community in Peru became a target, and their assets were confiscated.
""In May 1940, as many as 600 houses, schools and businesses belonging to citizens of Japanese descent were burned down,"" she says.
Following Japan's 1941 attack on the US naval base at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii, the US government asked a dozen Latin American countries, among them Peru, to arrest its Japanese residents.
Records from the time suggest the US authorities wanted to take them to the US and use them as bargaining chips for its nationals captured by Japanese forces in Asia.
Mr Katsura was among the 2,200 Latin Americans of Japanese descent who were forcibly deported to internment camps in the US.
Blanca Katsura, who is now 83 and lives in Northern California, remembers how she learned of his fate.
""A month after my father was detained, he sent me a letter because it was my birthday,"" she recalls.
""He had been taken to Panama from where they were planning to send him to the US,"" she adds.
Six months later, Blanca Katsura's mother decided to take her three small children to the US to search for her husband.
""When we arrived in New Orleans after a month-long trip, they confiscated our passports and then sent us by train to the Crystal City camp.""
As many as 4,000 people were interned during World War Two in this camp in Texas run by the US Immigration and Naturalization Service.
Most of the detainees were of Japanese descent, although some German and Italian immigrants were also held there.
It was at Crystal City that Blanca Katsura was reunited with her father. ""I was shocked, he had lost so much weight,"" she remembers.
For the next four years, her family lived in the barracks at the camp.
Her memories of that time are not particularly traumatic, she says.
""Being a child at the time time, I had no worries and made lots of friends.
""We were able to go to school and learn Japanese,"" she adds.
Ms Katsura says she later learned that the camp authorities were keen for the children to learn Japanese so they would be able to speak the language once they were deported to Japan.
Chieko Kamisato's memories of life at Crystal City are less positive.
""You could call it a concentration camp, because we were surrounded by barbed wire fences and guards with guns,"" she says.
""We couldn't go out at all, although we were free to move around inside,"" she recalls.
""My parents were really bitter about the situation because they were forced to come to the US. They had no choice,"" she says.
Ms Kamisato's father had moved to Peru from Japan in 1915 and had worked hard to open a bakery in the capital, Lima.
Now 81, she lives in Los Angeles.
Of the 2,200 Latin Americans of Japanese descent to be interned in the US, 800 were sent to Japan as part of prisoner exchanges.
After World War Two ended, another 1,000 were deported to Japan after their Latin American home countries refused to take them back.
Ms Katsura's and Ms Kamisato's families successfully fought deportation and were eventually allowed to remain in the US.
In 1988, then-President Ronald Reagan signed the Civil Liberties Act and apologised on behalf of the US government for the internment of Japanese-Americans.
Under the act, the government paid tens of thousands of survivors of the camps $20,000 (Â£13,000) each in reparation.
But Japanese-Latin Americans did not qualify for the payments because they had not been US citizens or permanent residents of the US at the time of their internment.
Outraged, they filed a class-action suit and 10 years later, the US government agreed to pay them $5,000 each.
Most accepted, but a small group headed by camp survivor Art Shibayama decided to hold out, demanding to be paid the same as Japanese-Americans.
Blanca Katsura says that even though her childhood at the camp may not have been traumatic, no amount of money can compensate her family for its loss.
""My parents wanted to go back to Peru but couldn't. They missed the life they had there,"" she recalls.
""The Peruvian government sold us out to the US government and that is not a very nice feeling. How would you feel about it?""",Blanca Katsura will never forget the night of 6 January 1943.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"John Griffith-Jones was asked at a Treasury Select Committee hearing whether the Treasury had leant on the FCA or undermined its independence.
He said that the ""simple answer"" was ""no to both"".
Acting chief executive Tracey McDermott said the suggestion was ""nonsense"".
Two senior FCA figures were speaking at a committee hearing called after it emerged that the inquiry, described as a ""thematic review"", had been scrapped.
The FCA had planned to look at whether pay, promotion or other incentives had contributed to scandals involving banks in the UK and abroad.
Ms McDermott told the committee the review had been shelved because ""we didn't think that we would be able to put out something that was sufficiently useful or valuable to make it worthwhile spending resources and time on doing it"".
She said the review would have duplicated other work carried out elsewhere, notably by the Banking Standards Board, which was ""looking at precisely the same issue"".
She said the FCA was now seeking to ""build on work done by other bodies"" and would be focusing on individual firms through regulatory supervision.
Banks around the world have faced huge fines from regulators for their involvement in numerous scandals.
In May last year, the news agency Reuters calculated that 20 global banks had paid Â£152bn in fines and compensation to customers since the 2008 financial crisis.","The chairman of the City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), has said political considerations played no part in its decision to shelve an inquiry into the culture of banking.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Their rise to third place in the polls comes despite a string of pre-election scandals.
One local candidate stood down after a picture emerged of her wearing a swastika armband.
Another was highlighted for posting racist and anti-immigrant comments online.
And yet, the revelations appear to have had little obvious effect on voters, even if the mainstream parties do not want anything to do with the party.
They are led by the dapper and clean-cut Jimmie Akesson, 35.
Voters also seemed unperturbed by the news that he has gambled half a million kronor (Â£43,000; 54,000 euros; $70,000) online.
""Every crisis the party gets into Mr Akesson handles very efficiently,"" says Ulf Bjereld, professor of political science at the University of Gothenburg, who sees him as a very skilful politician, if uncharismatic.
Any political party would struggle to fend off accusations of racism, he told the BBC, but the party leader simply took them off the list and said they were not welcome.
They will now occupy 49 seats in Sweden's 349-seat parliament.
By publicly stressing the Sweden Democrats' zero tolerance towards racism for the past two years, he has been careful not to fall out of step with the tolerance that Swedes believe they have towards ethnic minorities.
In contrast with other EU countries, Sweden is granting automatic residence to all refugees fleeing the Syrian conflict and some 80,000 people are expected to apply for asylum this year.
The Sweden Democrats have carefully refined their 2010 election platform, when their campaign commercial featured an elderly woman pushing slowly towards a welfare desk.
""You can choose if you want to save money from the pensions or immigration budgets,"" ran the commentary, over menacing music.
The pensioner is overtaken by a group of women in burqas.
The party made it into parliament in 2010 with 5.7% of the vote, five years after Jimmie Akesson took on the leadership.
Beforehand the party had been linked for years to neo-Nazis and other extremist groups.
In a speech in August, he identified himself as a nationalist but called for his party to show they were ""broad and inclusive"".
But he was forthright on the risks of political Islam.
""Islamism is the Nazism and communism of our time. It has to be met with disgust and much stronger resistance than has so far been the case.""
The anti-immigration rhetoric has been toned down and carefully argued, with a policy of preferring to help refugees in their own countries.
There are obvious parallels with France's National Front which, under the leadership of Marine Le Pen, has moved into the political mainstream.
The two parties go back many years, and Ms Le Pen visited Jimmie Akesson last year in Stockholm. A few months ago he praised the National Front's ""modern, quite fresh direction"".
That does not mean the Sweden Democrats have shaken off their past but, with two MEPs in the European Parliament, they are now part of the same grouping as the Eurosceptic UK Independence Party - the Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy group.
Swedish voters are attracted to the party, more because it gives a voice to people who dislike the political elite than its stance on immigration, Prof Bjereld believes.
And although he argues that party membership will always have a racist element, the main stance is more xenophobic than racist.
""One of Jimmie Akesson's skills is that he sends one message to the racists in his party and another to the general public.""","They see themselves as the kingmakers of Swedish politics and, after polling 13% in national elections, the far-right Sweden Democrats are now difficult for mainstream parties to ignore.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Hills Quarry Products has submitted a planning application to the county council for a sand and gravel quarry near the village of Clifton Hampden.
It said the development, known as Fullamoor Quarry, will see 2.5m tonnes of earth extracted over 10 years.
But residents said the plan poses a threat ""to the health and wellbeing"" of their communities.
Chairman of campaign group Bachport (Burcot and Clifton Hampden Protection of the River Thames) Ian Mason said: ""It's vital that people express their deep concerns.
""A quarry would devastate a tranquil part of the Oxford Green Belt bordering the Thames and we fear more flooding as the proposed site is in the flood plain.""
He added that the biggest concern was the traffic a quarry would generate, with 570 lorry movements a week.
Hills Quarry Products director Peter Andrew said the application followed an 18-month public consultation, which included meetings with residents.
He said: ""As a result of the feedback received, we significantly reduced our plans in relation to the volumes of material we hope to extract and the time we will take to work the site.
""The final restoration plans were also scaled back so that no additional material is brought on to site, which in turn reduced the overall number of vehicle movements.""
In a statement the company said the proposed quarry covers an area of 104 hectares, of which 76 hectares will be worked.
People have until 13 May to comment on the application.","A campaign group has urged people to object to a quarry they claim would ""devastate"" Oxfordshire's green belt.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Police said Alexandria Hollinghurst, 17, and Brandon Goode, 18, wrote what appeared to be suicide notes.
The notes were recovered before the pair were found dead in undergrowth on Saturday.
The head teacher of Miss Hollinghurst's former primary school in Derbyshire said she was a ""talented pupil"".
Her family had emigrated to the US six years ago.
Orange County Sheriff's Office said the couple had been reported as ""missing endangered due to the suicidal notes"" in the hours before the shooting.
A police spokesman said: ""Goode and Hollinghurst are now officially considered suspects in the homicide of Officer Robert German.
""While Goode and Hollinghurst died of what is believed to be gunshot wounds from apparent suicide, we are awaiting the medical examiner's findings for the exact cause of death.""
The shootings took place in the early hours of Saturday in the suburb of Windermere, Orlando.
The sheriff's office said Windermere Police Department Officer German had reported stopping ""two individuals"" on foot at 03:57 local time, and had then radioed for backup.
When colleagues arrived they discovered Officer German ""mortally wounded"" with a gunshot injury and he was later pronounced dead at Orlando Regional Medical Centre.
At the same time, gunshots were heard nearby and the bodies of Miss Hollinghurst and Mr Goode were discovered a short distance away, police said.
Miss Hollinghurst and her family previously lived in the Derbyshire village of Hadfield.
Tony McMylor, who lived next door to the family in Hadfield, believes Miss Hollinghurst was murdered.
""He shot her and then shot himself. That's what I believe,"" he said.
""I can feel for the parents. It's just horrendous.""

""She was a talented pupil who it was a pleasure to have in school.
""Alex was sociable with many friends and an outgoing personality. Our thoughts are with her family at this tragic time.""
Police said the contents of the apparent suicide notes ""will not be revealed at this time as the investigation is active and open"".

"The Coseley School in Dudley has 557 pupils - just over half its 975 capacity - and last year's GCSE results placed it bottom in the borough.
About 100 people protested outside Dudley Council house on Monday as the decision was made to put the closure plan to the public.
The consultation will run until 5 April, with a decision due in May.
'Safe haven'
If the plan goes ahead, years seven, eight and nine will go to different schools next year.
Current year 10's would stay and complete their GCSE's with the school shutting altogether in August 2017.
Head girl Tatiana Davies protested with fellow pupils against the closure.
She said: ""This place is like a safe haven for kids and it's a community that's being ripped apart by the council.
""It's not fair whatsoever that they've made a decision to do this... We care about our school so much.""
Councillor Ian Cooper, cabinet member for children's services, said: ""Proposing the closure of the school is very much the last resort and not something we have taken lightly.
""During recent years it has experienced a dramatic decline in pupil numbers, which are forecast to drop even more over the next three years, as well as results below the national minimum standards.
""We know the school has worked hard to try and raise attainment but unfortunately all these factors have led us to take this action.""

Last year, Ascend supported a team of 13 women climbed three peaks over 16,000 feet, including one previously unclimbed mountain which they subsequently named.
As they did not have enough boots for everyone, the women climbed in two teams, one getting use of the boots before swapping over so the others could go up.

"The four-piece group and their manager, who were aged between 19 and 32, died in the early hours of 13 February following a gig in Stockholm.
Their car crashed into a raised section of a bridge and plummeted into a canal.
The inquest heard no alcohol or drugs was found in the blood of manager Craig Tarry, 32, who was driving.
Post-mortem examinations also showed the four band members had not taken drugs and had only consumed small amounts of alcohol.
The band's agent Graham Bennett told the inquest at Warrington Coroner's Court that the up-and-coming group were in Sweden for a festival showcasing young artists.
Viola Beach had already played at the Reading and Leeds festivals last year and the Stockholm event was their first gig outside the UK.
After the performance, they were travelling in a black Nissan Qashqai near the SÃ¶dertÃ¤lje Canal, about 18 miles from the capital, when a bridge was raised to let a boat pass underneath.
The inquest heard that the car was slightly over the speed limit as it was travelling at 108km/h (67mph) in a 100km/h zone.
Flashing lights signalled that the bridge was about to be raised with the middle section of the road lifted horizontally, the inquest heard.
Mr Tarry drove down a verge past stationary queuing traffic and through the first set of barriers, about 120m from the bridge, the court heard.
The car then travelled in a ""controlled manner"" at between 70 and 90km/h down the centre of the road.
It continued through a second set of barriers - 30m from the drop into the canal - and hit the raised section of the bridge before plummeting 25m, hitting the water within 15 seconds.
The court heard a tanker using the canal, which had requested the bridge to be lifted, then passed over the crash spot and ""contact"" with the car could not be ruled out.
The crew of a passing boat saw the car fall but initially thought it was ice.
Technical examinations did not find any errors with the car, barrier system or the procedure for raising the bridge.
One warning light on the bridge was out of order but there were at least 10 warning lights and flashing signals, the inquest heard.
Although the road was wet, it was not frozen with ice.
Post-mortem examinations found that all died from head injuries apart from Mr Lowe whose cause of death was given as drowning.
The court heard that the three band members sitting in the back of the car were not wearing seatbelts but those in the front were, and had to be cut from the vehicle.
Cheshire Coroner Nicholas Rheinberg said ""none of the young men will have suffered"" as they died.
The Swedish authorities have recommended improvements to the crossing, including LED signs and cameras on the bridge.
In the wake of their deaths, the band's first single Swings & Waterslides reached number 11, while their song Boys That Sing was performed by Coldplay in a tribute at Glastonbury.
Posthumously, Viola Beach scored a number one album in August.

"The new rates will be implemented in October and will benefit a million workers.
Business Secretary Vince Cable said he had accepted a recommendation from the Low Pay Commission that the minimum wage should increase by 3%.
It is the first time in six years that the rise will be higher than inflation.
The rate for 18 to 20-year-olds will go up by 10p to £5.13 an hour, a 2% increase.
The rate for those aged 16 and 17 will rise by 7p to £3.79, also a 2% rise.
Apprentices will earn an extra 5p an hour, taking their wages to at least £2.73.
The consumer prices index (CPI) rate of inflation is currently 1.9%.
""The recommendations I have accepted today mean that low-paid workers will enjoy the biggest cash increase in their take-home pay since 2008,"" said Mr Cable.
He also suggested that all companies should consider helping their staff to share in the fruits of an improving economy.
""I urge businesses to consider how all their staff - not just those on the minimum wage - can enjoy the benefits of recovery,"" he said.
Meanwhile, the man who set up the minimum wage 15 years ago, said it is in need of major reform.
Professor Sir George Bain, founding chair of the Low Pay Commission, said the benchmark was a ""child of its times"" when launched in 1999.
But speaking to BBC Newsnight on Wednesday, he said it had become a ""blunt instrument"" and that many employers could now afford to pay their workers much more.
""If you set it at the 'living wage', which is about £7.65 an hour, you would cause massive unemployment in areas like retail and social care,"" Sir George added.
""But there's only about five sectors where this is true. There's a whole range of sectors where you could easily afford to pay more than the minimum wage.""
Sir George, who has chaired a review of the minimum wage for think-tank the Resolution Foundation, also said there should be a ""special case for London to have a higher national minimum"".
His report also recommends that the Low Pay Commission give longer-term forecasts for the benchmark, to help employers plan for the future.
The latest rise means the national minimum wage is still well below the definition of low pay, as set by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).
This equates to two-thirds of the median full-time hourly wage - about £7.71 an hour. About five million UK workers currently earn below that level.
The latest figure is also well below the living wage, which is £8.80 per hour in London, and £7.65 in the rest of the country.
""Across the country, people are struggling to make ends meet,"" said Dave Prentice, the head of the Unison trade union.
""The sooner we move to a living wage, the better,"" he said.
In January this year, Chancellor George Osborne said he backed the idea of the national minimum wage reaching £7 an hour by October 2015.
The latest announcement could pave the way for that to happen, but it would need a rise of more than 7% next year to do so.
Unite, the country's biggest trade union, said the rise announced was ""timid"".
""To make matters even worse, George Osborne cruelly held out hope that the rate would rise to £7,"" said Len McCluskey, Unite's general secretary.
""The government claims it is on the side of working people but companies are sitting on a cash mountain of £500bn and they should be forced to share more of it with the lowest paid,"" he added.","The national minimum wage will increase by 19p an hour to £6.50, the government has announced.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But with the lowest turnout in the constituency's history and a margin of 2,620 the narrowest ever recorded in this once proud Labour heartland, can this declaration really be believed?
It's a bright and windy day in Stoke-on-Trent.
The town has been at the centre of the political spotlight for weeks now, but people seem more interested in discussing the aftermath of Storm Doris than the small matter of Stoke Central's by-election result.
This staunch working class community was once passionately behind Labour.
In 1951, more than 60,000 went to the polls - 34,260 backing Labour.
Rather than feel victorious about Gareth Snell's win, Labour voters willing to talk simply seem relieved Paul Nuttall didn't clinch it.
In all, 7,853 voted for Mr Snell, compared to 5,233 who wanted UKIP to win.
Wendy Wright, 51, from Newcastle-under-Lyme, thought the vote for UKIP may have been higher had it not been for its disastrous campaign.
""I'm not surprised Labour won because of the way UKIP handled the campaign,"" she said.
""The people of Stoke seemed to think he [Paul Nuttall] didn't come from the area and they didn't believe his pack of lies.
""It's a relief UKIP didn't get in but [Labour retaining the seat] just means things are going to stay the same.""
Ms Wright said there had not been a high turnout because ""people aren't interested in politics"".
She said: ""They've kind of lost faith and lost hope. They think, what's the point, nothing's going to change.
""It's a deprived area and it's a shame because the people are so welcoming and friendly.""
Veronica Millington, 71, from Blythe Bridge, said she and husband Anthony, 75, were ""Labour through and through"".
They backed Mr Snell in the by-election and also voted to stay in the European Union.
""I think the people of Stoke do care about politics and they want to make things better,"" she said.
""I think they were misled by UKIP in the beginning. They seemed to promise them so much and people saw it as a new chance really.
""It was only when all the lies came out they saw how many wrong things had been said.""
Mr Millington, 75, expressed concern about why so few people bothered to go to the polls.
""The turnout seemed to be very low and I think a lot of people think it was a foregone conclusion.
""They thought the Labour Party would win. Now whether or not they've had a jolt from the outsider now, I don't know.""
For a city that has had such a strong relationship with the Labour party, the changing political landscape over the past seven decades reveals a lot about the strength of feeling in the community.
Labour has won all 18 elections since since the inception of the Stoke Central constituency, with the Conservatives coming second until 2001.
But although Labour enjoyed a heyday in the 1960s and 70s, their share of the vote has consistently fallen over the years down to a record low of 37% in this by-election.
So why did this city of proud, working class voters fall out of love with Labour?
""Things started to change because of a growing alienation of the people of Stoke-on-Trent from Westminster,"" says Prof Mick Temple from Staffordshire University.
""Industry was decimated in the 1980s - coal, steel and the Potteries.
""When I first came here [in the early 90s] infrastructure was poor, schools were poor and still today, unemployment is higher than the national average.""
From the closure of Shelton Steel Works - where 10,000 once worked - to the shrinking of its famous pottery industry, the people of Stoke-on-Trent have lived through some turbulent times.
But the bleak images of derelict factories and houses often shown by the media are not a true reflection of the passion and pride of a community that is fiercely proud of its heritage.
Data shows 6.2% of adults in Stoke Central claim unemployment benefit, far higher than the national average of 3.8%.
In recent years employers such as Bet365, Michelin Tyres and Goodwin have invested millions of pounds into their businesses, providing jobs for thousands of people.
Hanley's famous pottery industry is also enjoying something of a resurgence, with Emma Bridgewater investing more than Â£1m in its thriving ceramics factory.
Middleport Pottery, home of world-famous Burleigh, is in the national spotlight thanks to the success of BBC Two's The Great Pottery Throw Down.
Millions of pounds are being spent regenerating the city.
For many people though, the investment has been too little, too late.
""The feeling is that the city has been passed by Westminster and the EU, and that is why people voted Leave so overwhelmingly,"" says Prof Temple.
""There are many towns in the north of England where people feel the same - areas that are ripe for UKIP.""
From 2005, the BNP and UKIP began to resonate with voters, coming fourth and fifth in that year's election and again in 2010.
By 2015, UKIP had won so much support its candidate Mick Harold came second to Tristram Hunt for a seat that had the lowest voter turnout in the whole of the UK.
Pub owner Tony Flackett, 69, backed Paul Nuttall in Thursday's poll.
""It feels sad, it's such a shame, they've worked really hard and people have come from all over the country.
""I've always voted for Conservatives but the last two years I voted UKIP because of Brexit and immigration.
""But life goes on and at least they reduced the margin.""
Tom Wilson, 26, voted for UKIP in the by-election and said he was ""very upset"" at the result.
""I think Labour winning is very bad news for Stoke-on-Trent.
""There has been years of neglect in Stoke with money spent only on Hanley.
""I think only UKIP would have made a change for the people of Stoke.""
UKIP has made moves to appeal to former Labour voters, as well as those who formerly backed the Tories.
""They're more pro-State, pro-NHS. They recognise that strong nationalistic message supported by the working class,"" says Prof Temple.
Between the 2001 and 2011 Censuses, the non-white population doubled and there was a relatively high population of Muslims, he said.
""I'm not saying the response was a racist one - Stoke-on-Trent was getting less and less money from the government and the EU and the feeling was the traditional working class community was being overtaken.
""Many working class voters felt they could not express their views within the Labour party.
""The BNP and UKIP gave them a chance to say how they felt.""
Now Mr Snell is the town's new MP, the challenge is on for him to win back the trust of former Labour supporters and engage with new ones.
Lee Woolrich, 33, from Stoke-on-Trent, is head of client services for a digital agency but did not vote in the by-election.
""I'm ashamed really that I didn't use my vote, but I almost don't think I invest enough in politics to make an informed decision,"" he said.
""I don't think young people are engaged in politics. I think they are more so recently because of what's happened in America.
""I read about Paul Nuttall and some of his views and policies and I don't believe it's what we need here.""
Mr Woolrich believes politicians need to take more of an interest in Stoke-on-Trent - he too feels the place has been forgotten and is badly represented by the media.
""Stoke is doing great without those kinds of ideas.
""I love the developments in Hanley and the cultural quarter.
""Stoke is showing signs of change and getting in line with cities like Manchester.
""On a local level, I like the direction things are going in but I don't necessarily think government in London will listen to the people of Stoke.
""I hate that stigma that Stoke isn't a nice place to live.
""It doesn't do the place justice. It's a beautiful city steeped in history.""
And Prof Temple agrees. ""It's a much more attractive place,"" he said.
""I've been here for 24 years, I've lived all around the world and this is the friendliest, most coherent community I've ever known.
""Stoke-on-Trent has an identity most places in the UK have lost.
""There's a very strong sense of community. It's a place where friendship and family is still strong.""","In the wake of his victory, Stoke Central's new Labour MP Gareth Snell claimed it had been a triumph for the ""politics of hope"".",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

""It's always a tough position as a kind of interim manager, especially with the way things have gone,"" on-loan Bournemouth midfielder Hyndman added.
""But I credit him for coming in and establishing what he wants us to do. I think the boys got behind him quite well.
""The results didn't really show what he was doing and how good he was but it was nice to give him that positive feeling on Wednesday night.""

And with the Premiership gap between third-placed Rangers and second-placed Aberdeen now cut to six points, USA international Hyndman says there is still plenty to play for this term.
""Of course there is,"" he said. ""We saw the Aberdeen result the other night (1-0 defeat at Hamilton) but we're just focused on ourselves at the same time.

"A report by technology news site Gizmodo said staff responsible for what was shown to Facebook's 1.6bn users frequently chose to bury articles they did not agree with.
Responding to the allegations, the network's head of search Tom Stocky wrote that the site ""found no evidence that the anonymous allegations are true"".
The claims come weeks after Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg publicly denounced the policies of likely US presidential nominee, Donald Trump.
""I hear fearful voices calling for building walls and distancing people they label as 'others.',"" the 31-year-old said at his firm's recent developers conference.
However, Facebook insisted Mr Zuckerberg's view did not influence what stories are given added visibility on the network.
The Trending Topics column appears in the top right corner of a typical Facebook page. It is designed to highlight what subjects are being discussed heavily by Facebook users around the world.
Facebook explained in a statement that this list was edited by humans so as to avoid regularly recurring popular topics - such as ""lunch"".
Facebook's Mr Stocky explained: ""Popular topics are first surfaced by an algorithm, then audited by review team members to confirm that the topics are in fact trending news in the real world and not, for example, similar-sounding topics or misnomers.""
The Gizmodo story, which quoted a person it said they had been one of the editors, alleged Facebook staff were routinely tampering with Trending Topic stories.
Gizmodo's source added that staff were told to seek out stories published on the BBC, CNN and other mainstream sites ahead of publications with a clearly stated political bias - even if the stories originated on those smaller outlets.
Also, if several mainstream media sites were covering the same story, Facebook would - according to the source - artificially place it in the Trending Topic column, even if it was not being discussed heavily by users.
Breitbart, one of the leading conservative news sources in the US, said the reports confirmed what they had ""long suspected"", that ""Facebook's trending news artificially mutes conservatives and amplifies progressives"".
The anonymous source also claimed that stories staff favoured - such as the Black Lives Matter movement - were given artificially greater prominence. Facebook said that this was ""untrue"".
After a day of growing reports across social media and in conservative-leaning publications, Facebook's Mr Stocky posted a response on his profile.
""We have in place strict guidelines for our trending topic reviewers as they audit topics surfaced algorithmically,"" he wrote.
""Reviewers are required to accept topics that reflect real world events, and are instructed to disregard junk or duplicate topics, hoaxes, or subjects with insufficient sources.
""Facebook does not allow or advise our reviewers to systematically discriminate against sources of any ideological origin and we've designed our tools to make that technically not feasible.
""At the same time, our reviewers' actions are logged and reviewed, and violating our guidelines is a fireable offense.""

"Speaking during a live link-up with a primary school in London, he also said he was ""immensely proud"" to be wearing the Union Flag.
Major Peake added that he was now into the final phase of training, in which he was focusing on the essentials.
He said astronaut training had been rigorous and involved retaining immense quantities of information.
Tim Peake is the first Briton to be selected as an astronaut for the European Space Agency, through a route backed by the UK government.
He was in Houston, Texas, when he spoke live to schoolchildren at Queen's Park Primary School in West London. The event was organised as part of a UK Space Agency programme called Esero, which is designed to use space to help enhance science education.
""I'm immensely proud to be British and to be serving in the European Space Agency,"" he told BBC News.
""It's always very apparent to me, wherever I'm travelling, whether it be Houston, here, or Russia, that you're wearing the flag and you're representing your country.""
Major Peake, who was a British Army helicopter pilot before his selection for the astronaut corps, is set to fly to the International Space Station in December on a Russian Soyuz rocket.
He will be accompanied on the launch from Baikonur Cosmodrome by the American astronaut Timothy Kopra and the Russian Yuri Malenchenko.
The Briton said the training was now ""ramping up"" as the 15 December launch date approached.
""The training is a long process and we've covered such a huge variety of subjects. One of the main challenges is actually being able to retain all of that information over a two-and-a-half-year period,"" he said.
""I'm in the final six months before launch and we're just focusing on the essentials of the Soyuz spacecraft, emergency training... and scientific payloads that are going to be on the space station.""
Pupils who listened to Major Peake talk, and got the opportunity to ask him questions, seemed to be impressed by the experience.
Abdullah Hashim, who is 10, said he was ""an extraordinary man"" and an ""inspiration"". Salma Sarumi, 8, said it was ""amazing"" to have the live link-up at her school.
Fellow students Cherise Panzu, Mario Albu and Susu El-Abbas also seemed to have been inspired by the event. Cherise called it a ""once in a lifetime opportunity"".
Major Peake believes the flight will bring significant benefits to the country and British industry.
""This is a step forward in that it's the UK government supporting human spaceflight,"" he explained.
""What that means is that UK industry, UK education and the UK scientific community can now embrace human spaceflight. That means taking part in scientific research that's being conducted not only on the International Space Station, but within the other European Space Agency human spaceflight programmes.""","The UK's first official astronaut, Tim Peake, says he is ""well prepared"" as his December launch date approaches.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It means BP will have to make the payments that stem from the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig.
BP argued that the deal meant it could fall prey to inflated or bogus compensation claims.
BP agreed to the compensation deal in 2012, but argues it has been misinterpreted.
Shares in BP fell 1.7% in London on Monday.
BP asked the Supreme Court to consider whether people and businesses seeking payments under the settlement included individuals who had not actually suffered any injury as a result of the oil spill.
The Supreme Court's rejection of this appeal by BP is the latest in a series of setbacks for the oil firm.
BP is trying to limit payments over the environmental disaster, which claimed the lives of 11 people and became the largest US offshore oil spill in history.
The settlement agreement has no cap, but BP initially estimated that it would pay roughly $7.8bn (Â£6.1bn) to compensate victims.
It now says it can no longer give a reliable estimate for how much the deal will cost.
BP has already paid out $2.3bn in so-called business economic loss claims out of a total of $4.25bn in compensation claims to individuals and businesses, according to Patrick Juneau, the administrator appointed by the courts to handle claims.
The settlement process is also separate from other court proceedings relating to the spill, including environmental and criminal penalties.
BP has set aside $43bn to resolve all claims.

"HS2 Ltd is overseeing the expansion of Euston to cater for passengers using the first phase of the new rail line between London and the Midlands.
The revamp was originally scheduled to end in 2026 but the firm now says it will finish in 2033.
Camden Council has warned the extended works will ""blight"" the area, but HS2 says it will be ""easier to manage"".
The station is set to gain six new platforms and an additional concourse, with building works due to start in 2017.
In a change to plans submitted two years ago, HS2 Ltd has proposed the construction of five further platforms within the existing station should be delayed.
They would be ready for phase two of HS2 which will run from the capital to Leeds and Manchester in 2033.
Rupert Walker, Euston development director of HS2 Ltd, said: ""It is more construction over a longer period but it's less intense. It will be easier for us to manage.""
The impact of building all 11 platforms in one go would have caused a reduction in the capacity of trains using Euston every day, he said.
Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said the changes would ""dramatically improve the design"" of the station.
Sarah Hayward, leader of Camden Council, predicted: ""HS2 will cause decades of blight in the Euston area - to property prices, to our small business' trade and to our residents' lives.""
She said the council is ""ardently opposed to the scheme"", adding it could only be a success with ""close collaboration"" between the local authority, residents and businesses.
HS2 Ltd's new plan will be submitted to Parliament next week in order to form part of the legislation which will allow phase one of High Speed 2 to go ahead.

"Mr Miliband called the prime minister's refusal to take part unless the Green Party was involved a ""pathetic excuse"".
He said he would debate with ""anyone invited by the broadcasters"".
But Mr Cameron said the Labour leader was ""chickening"" out of facing the Greens and all ""national parties"" must be represented.
The exchanges came after Mr Miliband, Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg and UKIP leader Nigel Farage urged broadcasters to press ahead with televised debates before the 7 May poll even if Mr Cameron refuses to take part.
The three leaders have written to Mr Cameron saying it would be ""unacceptable"" for the prime minister to refuse to appear, saying an empty podium should be provided in his absence.
In response, the BBC, Sky News, ITV and Channel 4 said they ""remain committed"" to staging debates before the poll on 7 May.
Raising the issue in Parliament, Mr Miliband said Mr Cameron had argued back in 2010 that it would be ""feeble"" for any party leader to walk away from the debates but was now threatening to do just that.
A high stakes poker game in which the ultimate prize is power - that is what the row about TV leaders election debate has now become.
The players at the table are not just the nation's party leaders but also the bosses of the country's biggest broadcasters.
Watching and waiting are highly paid lawyers who know that this may end up being resolve by a judge and not by the court of public opinion.
The question is - will anyone blink before it gets to the court-room?

""It is not for him, it is not for me, it is not for any party leader to decide who is in the debate,"" he said. ""It is up to the broadcasters, that is the country we live in.
""I think he does protest too much. He has run out of excuses, he is running scared of these debates and in the words of his heroine Margaret Thatcher 'he is frit'"".
Mr Cameron said Mr Miliband wanted ""to debate having a debate"" because he did not want to talk about the economy and other issues.
He said he was keen to defend his record during the campaign, suggesting he would support the idea of two debates, one a head-to-head encounter between him and Mr Miliband and another in which all ""national parties"" were represented.
""The more time he and I can spend on television and in the television studio, the happier I will be,"" he said.
But Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, who was sitting next to the prime minister, was heard shouting ""excuses, excuses"" as Mr Cameron answered one of Mr Miliband's questions.
In identical letters to Mr Cameron, Mr Miliband, Mr Clegg and Mr Farage called for a repeat of the 2010 debates - the first ever leaders' TV debates in a British election - and insisted they ""not the property of the politicians"".
They wrote: ""I believe it would be a major setback to our democratic processes if these debates were not repeated in 2015 because of one politician's unwillingness to participate.""
The added: ""Therefore, if you are unwilling to reconsider, the three party leaders who have committed to participate will ask the broadcasters to press ahead with the debates and provide an empty podium should you have a last-minute change of heart.""
Under plans put forward by the BBC, Sky News, ITV and Channel 4 in October, the pre-election live TV debates would include the Conservatives, Labour, Liberal Democrats and UKIP.
Mr Cameron would take on Labour leader Mr Miliband head-to-head in one debate, another would feature Mr Cameron, Mr Miliband and Lib Dem leader Mr Clegg, and a third would also include UKIP's Mr Farage.
The suggested schedule is for debates on 2 April, 16 April and 30 April, ahead of the general election on 7 May.
Mr Farage said the BBC would be ""within its rights"", under the terms of its editorial guidelines, to stage a debate without Mr Cameron and providing an empty podium would be ""entirely appropriate"".
""If David Cameron chooses not to turn up that is his hard luck,"" he told the BBC News Channel. ""My guess is that if the broadcasters hold firm, Mr Cameron will buckle and say yes.""
Lord Ashdown, who is leading the Lib Dems' general election campaign, urged broadcasters to ""stick to their guns"" or else he feared the impetus for the debates would ""ebb away"".
He told Sky News: ""You just can't let the prime minister or anybody else basically hold the country and our democracy to ransom by saying no.""
But Green Party leader Natalie Bennett said she backed Mr Cameron's stance and said it was in the interest of the three other leaders to help persuade broadcasters that her party should be included in one of the debates.
Ms Bennett said ITV had not yet made a final decision and she hoped to hold talks with the broadcaster in the near future.
""Staging the debates without the prime minister might score a point but would not serve the public, who rightly expect the political parties and the broadcasters to find a format that is acceptable to all concerned,"" she wrote in a letter to the trio.
""If you indicated that you were open to the inclusion of the Greens, then I feel sure that ITV would respond.""
John Curtice, professor of politics at the University of Strathclyde, said that having ""nailed his colours to the mast"" over the Green Party's participation, it would be difficult for Mr Cameron to shun the debates if they were invited.
The three debates in 2010 were watched by a total of 22 million people, and they have been cited as one reason for the increase in turnout at the election, which rose for the first time since 1992.
While the debates were a ""good test of political leadership"", Prof Curtice told the BBC that they had dominated the campaign and ""not necessarily succeeded in reaching out to more marginal voters"".
The SNP and Plaid Cymru, which have more seats in Parliament than either UKIP or the Green Party, also say they should be represented in any series of debates.
SNP deputy leader Stuart Hosie said: ""The idea that the SNP, bigger than UKIP and the Lib Dems combined in terms of membership, should be excluded from debates which are broadcast into people's homes in Scotland is just simply quite unacceptable.""
In a statement, the four broadcasters said: ""The debates played an important role in informing millions of our viewers in 2010 and we will continue to work with all the parties to ensure that they happen again in 2015"".

"Prof Higgs, who does not own a mobile phone, said a former neighbour had pulled up in her car as he was returning from lunch in Edinburgh.
He added: ""She congratulated me on the news and I said 'oh, what news?'""
The woman had been alerted by her daughter in London that Prof Higgs had won the award, he revealed.
He added: ""I heard more about it obviously when I got home and started reading the messages.""
The 84-year-old emeritus professor at the University of Edinburgh was recognised by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences for his work on the theory of the particle which shares his name, the Higgs boson.
He shares this year's physics prize with Francois Englert of Belgium, and joins the ranks of past Nobel winners including Marie Curie and Albert Einstein.
The existence of the so-called ""God particle"", said to give matter its substance, or mass, was proved almost 50 years later by a team from the European nuclear research facility (Cern) and its Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in Geneva, Switzerland.
Speaking for the first time about the award at a media conference at the University of Edinburgh, he said: ""How do I feel? Well, obviously I'm delighted and rather relieved in a sense that it's all over. It has been a long time coming.""
An old friend told him he had been nominated as far back as 1980, he said.
Prof Higgs added: ""In terms of later events, it seemed to me for many years that the experimental verification might not come in my lifetime.
""But since the start up of the LHC it has been pretty clear that they would get there, and despite some mishaps they did get there"".
Stressing the involvement of other theorists and Cern, he added: ""I think clearly they should, but it is going to be even more difficult for the Nobel Committee to allocate the credit when it comes to an organisation like Cern.
""I should remind you that although only two of us have shared this prize, Francois Englert of Brussels and myself, that the work in 1964 involved three groups of people, (including) two in Brussels.
""Unfortunately Robert Brout died a few years ago so is no longer able to be awarded the prize, but he would certainly have been one of the winners if he had still been alive.
""But there were three others who also contributed and it is already difficult to allocate the credit amongst the theorists.
""Although a lot of people seem to think I did all this single-handed, it was actually part of a theoretical programme which had been started in 1960.""
Prof Higgs was born in Newcastle, but developed his theory while working at the University of Edinburgh.
The landmark research that defined what was to become known as the Higgs boson was published in 1964.
Discovering the particle became one of the most sought-after goals in science, and the team of scientists behind the $10bn LHC at Cern made proving its existence a key priority.
In July of last year, physicists at Cern confirmed the discovery of a particle consistent with the Higgs boson.
Prof Higgs, who had often been uncomfortable with the attention his theory brought, was in Geneva to hear the news, and wiped a tear from his eye as the announcement was made.
Reacting to the discovery at the time, he told reporters: ""It's very nice to be right sometimes.""",Nobel Prize-winning scientist Prof Peter Higgs has revealed he did not know he had won the award until a woman congratulated him in the street.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"The unnamed woman had agreed Greater Manchester Police (GMP) could refer to her experience in a training session providing she remained anonymous.
However, she later learned her identity and medical history were disclosed to a wider audience.
GMP has apologised and said ""steps"" had been taken to stop similar occurrences.
The victim's solicitor said the payout was believed to be one of the biggest by a British force in a privacy case.
In a witness statement, the woman, who agreed to an out-of-court settlement, said she ""felt betrayed by GMP"".
The errors in this case by Greater Manchester Police almost beggar belief. Safeguarding victims is the most important priority in domestic violence police work.
Revealing a victim's identity, medical history and distressed 999 call, against their wishes, represents very grave mistakes. This episode is hardly likely to increase victims' confidence in the police.
The case also illustrates the use of part of the civil law that has principally been seen in cases involving celebrities whose privacy has been breached by newspapers.
'Misuse of private information' has been argued in a number of cases. It relies on a breach of Article 8 of the 1988 Human Rights Act; the right to respect for a private and family life.
The claimant has to establish they have a reasonable expectation of privacy in relation to the information concerned, and that privacy has been breached.
The media can argue the claimant's right to privacy is outweighed by the right to freedom of expression and that there is a public interest in publishing. The police have no such defence.
This case shows that Article 8 is not simply for celebrities and that public bodies, such as the police, can be sued if they breach it.
Nick McAleenan, from JMW Solicitors, described his client as a ""successful, professional woman"".
He said she ""suffered psychiatric harm"" after learning that her personal information was disclosed and that a tape of her 999 call following an assault was played at a training session.
He added that GMP had initially refused to accept it had done anything wrong and its internal investigation concluded that no officer had infringed the police code of conduct.
In May 2014, the force admitted breaching the woman's privacy but refused to acknowledge she had suffered distress or loss as a result which would entitle her to any damages.
Mr McAleenan said: ""This is information out there in the public domain. She can't put the genie back in the bottle and it's something that she is going to have to live with for the rest of her life"".
A GMP spokeswoman said it was ""an exceptional case"", adding: ""The force has taken action to protect the individual's information to prevent any issue in the future.""
She added: ""We have apologised to the woman involved... This was an unacceptable mistake; however, it was done with the best of intentions as part of training for partner agencies around recognising the signs of domestic abuse.""
A spokesperson from the domestic abuse charity, Women's Aid, said: ""Survivors of domestic abuse should be able to expect the highest standards from the police - and the police should be extremely careful when dealing with survivors.
""The survivor in question could have been put in a very dangerous situation; highly manipulative perpetrators of domestic abuse will stop at nothing to find out where their former partner is, or to gather information on them.""","A domestic abuse victim has received £75,000 from a police force after it revealed details of her treatment by a former boyfriend without her consent.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Johnson-Thompson has said her main aim this weekend is to get the 6,200 points needed for Rio.
She needs 2,268 points on Sunday in the three remaining events.
The 23-year-old began the day equalling her personal best of 13.37 seconds in the 100m hurdles and followed it up by clearing 1.92m in the high jump, a personal best outdoors.
After two events, Johnson-Thompson was in the overall lead but slipped to sixth following a disappointing 11.55m in the shot put - the worst mark in the field and 1.59m below the personal best she set earlier in the season.
She made amends for that poor display with a personal best 22.79 secs in the 200m, which pulled her closer to Canada's world silver medallist Theisen-Eaton.
Johnson-Thompson will start with the long jump on Sunday, the event which ruined her chances of gold at last year's World Championships following her failure to record a legal jump.
She said: ""I'm sure I'll be nervous again in the long jump. I really want to get a good jump in the first round.
""This is my first big competition especially after a knee operation last autumn so I just want 6,200 points and to be injury free and to be going home with my ticket for the Olympics.""
The Briton has also said her experience in Beijing changed her, created a ""new Kat"" who is determined to bounce back and quash her demons.
Her performances on the opening day in Austria promised much not only for this competition but the summer ahead.
Although she has repeatedly said Olympic qualification rather than regaining the title she won in 2014 is her priority this weekend, she looks set to vie with favourite Theisen-Eaton for first place.
And despite a poor display in the shot, her weakest event, Johnson-Thompson will take heart that she achieved her best heptathlon score of 6682 points in Gotzis two years ago, when her total after the opening day was also 3923.

"A ceremony, attended by PM Shinzo Abe, was held at Hiroshima's memorial park before thousands of lanterns are released on the city's Motoyasu river.
The bombing - and a second one on Nagasaki three days later - is credited with bringing to an end World War Two.
But it claimed the lives of at least 140,000 people in the city.
A US B-29 bomber called the Enola Gay dropped the uranium bomb, exploding some 600m (1,800ft) above the city, at around 08:10 on 6 August 1945.
On that day alone, at least 70,000 people are believed to have been killed. Many more died of horrific injuries caused by radiation poisoning in the days, weeks and months that followed.
People across Japan have observed a minute's silence to mark the anniversary. In Hiroshima a bell tolled at 08:15 local time - when the US aircraft dropped the bomb that flattened the city centre.
Addressing 40,000 people who attended the commemoration ceremony at Hiroshima's peace park near the epicentre of the 1945 attack, Mr Abe called for worldwide nuclear disarmament.
He said that that atomic bomb not only killed thousands of people in Hiroshima but also caused unspeakable suffering to survivors.
""Today Hiroshima has been revived,"" the prime minister said, ""and has become a city of culture and prosperity.
""Seventy years on I want to reemphasise the necessity of world peace.""
Mr Abe and Hiroshima Mayor Kazumi Matusi were joined by US Ambassador to Japan Caroline Kennedy for the official ceremony of remembrance on Thursday, which included silent prayers, the release of doves and a declaration of peace.
Mr Matsui described nuclear weapons as an ""absolute evil"" while urging the world to put an end to them forever.
""To coexist we must abolish the... ultimate inhumanity that is nuclear weapons. Now is the time to start taking action,"" he said in his annual speech.
Later in the day, thousands of paper lanterns will be released on the city's Motoyasu River - symbolising the journey to the afterlife of those who died.

The company was not spying on its staff, he said, saying the move was designed to protect them from the ""anguish"" of not realising a person had been inside the bin.
Mr Standring, the firm's divisional health, safety, environment and quality coach, said: ""If it's the only place you've got to stay and it's the most secure place I can kind of see the appeal, but the down side of it is if we don't find you, you're not going to survive.""
He added: ""Once you're in the hopper, the blade comes down and it crushes and breaks the waste and it will take it back into the body [of the vehicle] where it's compacted again.
""These machines won't differentiate between cardboard, wood and unfortunately people as well.""
Biffa hopes that all of its refuse lorries will have the new technology by the end of the year.
The company formed a partnership with the Chartered Institute of Waste Management and homelessness service StreetLink to raise awareness of the issue of people sleeping in bins.
The organisations carried out research last year that showed that 28 of the 176 waste management organisations surveyed reported finding people sheltering in bins over the previous 12 months.",One of the UK's biggest waste companies is fitting cameras to its vehicles in a bid to reduce the number of homeless people killed after sleeping rough in industrial-sized wheelie bins.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pistorius, 29, was given a five-year term for manslaughter in 2014, but was found guilty of murder last December after a prosecution appeal.

"The Gobbins coastal path in Islandmagee was the brainchild of Irish railway engineer Berkley Deane Wise.
It first opened in 1902 and quickly became famous as a white knuckle walk.
Edwardian era visitors were able to have a close encounter with waves and wildlife.
The path, which is carved into black basalt cliffs, was an engineering triumph - it's connected by a network of walkways and bridges - the most iconic of which was the tubular bridge.
Post-war austerity spelt decline for the 1.5 mile walkway and it was closed to the public in the 1950s.
Since then only seabirds have enjoyed the stunning views from this part of our coastline.
Rumblings down the years about restoring the path finally turned into action in 2013, when the restoration project got under way.
Since then, £7.5m has been spent replacing bridges, hand rails and constructing a new visitors centre.
The tubular bridge has been replaced with an almost identical replica.
While modern engineering methods have made the work safer, construction worker Paul Montgomery says he has an enhanced respect for those who built the original path.
""They did an immense job, because the beams I have seen from the old bridges were concrete cased and to get them down here would have been a feat in itself as there were no cranes in those days,"" he said.
""So I have a lot of respect for them.""
While health and safety is more of a concern nowadays some things have not changed, including the steep walk down to the starting point - a hole through rock known as Wise's eye.
Before starting the Gobbins experience, visitors are given a safety briefing and a hard hat in the visitors centre, it's then on to a minibus for the two-mile journey to the path.
The walk is described as strenuous and is not suitable for everyone.
No-one under the height of 1.2m will be permitted, a good level of fitness is required and people with cardiac, respiratory, asthmatic or joint conditions are urged not to attempt it.
The route allows visitors to see coastal birds such as puffins, guillemots and kittiwakes up close. It's also possible to spot porpoises off the coast.
This attraction has created some much needed employment in the area and one of the tour guides is Robert Stewart, a local farmer who has decided to try something new.
""I'm very enthusiastic about my new job,"" he said.
""Everybody knows about the Giant's Causeway but I think we have something here that can compete with the Giant's Causeway and is just as beautiful.""
Groups of 10 to 15 will be guided along the bridges which cling to the cliff face just metres above the sea.
Tours should be booked in advance and the costs are £8.50 for adults, concessions £6 and a family rate of £23.
There will also be a cliff top walk which will be free for the public and has a viewing platform that hangs over the cliff.  This element of the work is not expected to be complete until September.
The project is over a year late and £1.5m over budget, but Mid and East Antrim Council has big hopes for the attraction and is expecting 50,000 visitors a year.
Tourism Minister Jonathan Bell, who walked the path on Tuesday, said it was ""staggeringly beautiful"".
""It is something that you could bring visitors from anywhere in the world to and be very proud of the quality of the tourism offering,"" he said.
""Having done it, I think it represents real value for money and puts Northern Ireland with another - and I genuinely mean this -  top quality, international tourist destination.""
The council's mayor Billy Ashe said it was fantastic for the area.
""I think that first and foremost it will put us back on the map,"" he said.
""Berkley Deane Wise thought that this path could be one of the world's attractions - I agree with him.
""I think people will be coming here for many, many, many years to feast their eyes on this marvellous achievement.""",A dramatic cliff face walk in County Antrim that was built more than a century ago has reopened to the public after multi-million pound revamp.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Jason Woodward's try put them ahead but Josh Bassett, Tommy Taylor and Joe Simpson scored as Wasps went in ahead.
Christian Wade, Guy Thompson and Bassett went over for the visitors for a bonus point, which deflated Bristol.
The hosts rallied, Jack O'Connell and Nick Fenton-Wells touching down, but it could not stop them from going down.
Having finished top of the Championship in five seasons before finally winning promotion in the play-offs last year, Bristol will return to the second-tier at the first time of asking.
After Worcester's win over Bath on Saturday, Mark Tainton's Bristol needed two points from the game to prolong their relegation battle, but they lacked a clinical streak.
It leaves them 12 points adrift at the bottom of the table, with a maximum of 10 points on offer from their final two matches.
Wasps were far from at their best, on the back foot for much of the game, but have restored their five-point lead at the top and need one win from their last two to secure a home semi-final in the play-offs.
The Premiership's top try-scorer Wade, on his 100th appearance for Dai Young's side, did his England hopes no harm with his 16th score of the campaign.
Bristol were promoted to the top tier on 25 May after winning their two-legged play-off final, with the Premiership season starting just 100 days later.
Director of rugby Andy Robinson, a former England head coach, was sacked in November after his side lost their first 10 games of the campaign.
Tainton took interim charge and Bristol finally got their first league win against Worcester on Boxing Day, following it up with victory at Sale and a losing bonus point at Northampton, but it was a false dawn.
The scrapping of the Championship play-offs, meaning the team that finishes top will gain automatic promotion, may give Bristol more time to plan ahead next season if they are successful.
Connacht boss Pat Lam will have the task of bringing Bristol back into the Premiership, having signed a three-year deal in December to become head coach from June.
Tainton will remain at the helm for their final two matches at Saracens and at home to Newcastle, and remains optimistic about the future of the club.
""Obviously it's disappointing to get relegated, but we've put a plan in place whether we were going to stay in the Premiership or get relegated,"" he said.
""We have the infrastructure at Ashton Gate to be a Premiership team - we're not going to be next year, but hopefully the supporters will still watch us in that league.
""Bristol more than most know what a difficult league it (the Championship) is, but hopefully we can bounce back very quickly.""
Bristol interim head coach Mark Tainton:
""It was a similar story to a lot of games - we've created an awful lot, we've been in the opposition 22 many times but we've just not executed and got across the line.
""We give Wasps an opportunity and they score tries, it's as simple as that - that's the difference in the level we need to get to.
""We were down and beaten in the second half but we played right until the very end of the game - I expect that from them in the next two games.""
Wasps director of rugby Dai Young:
""Obviously there are still things to work on, especially our starts - I thought our first 10 minutes, again, we made far too many mistakes and gave ourselves a bit of a hill to climb.
""We just had enough to do it but we make it hard for us really - there's room to improve in every area, but I'm pretty pleased and felt we looked in control for most of the game.
""It's up to us to nail it (a top-two finish) ourselves - we're not relying on other people.""

"Virginia Raggi said more arrivals could exacerbate social tension.
Her call follows local elections on Sunday in which the Five Star Movement performed poorly.
More than 500,000 people have arrived by boat since 2014. Nearly 200,000 are being housed in  centres across the country.
""We cannot permit the creation of more social tensions,"" Ms Raggi said on Facebook.
""That is why I am saying it is impossible, risky even, to think about creating any new reception structures.""
The interior ministry has asked all Italian municipalities to find space for an expected 250,000 new migrants this year, up from about 180,000 last year.
Some observers say Ms Raggi is attempting to win back support by targeting migrants after her party failed to make the run-off in 24 of the main 25 cities choosing a new mayor.
About half of Italians do not want the country to take in more people, pollster Renato Mannheimer told Reuters news agency.
Italy is accommodating rising numbers of migrants because countries to the north have tightened their borders and some EU states have refused to take part in a plan to relocate 160,000 people from Italy and Greece.
Just over 20,000 migrants have so far been relocated under the plan and the EU has begun legal action against against Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic for refusing to accept refugees.
An estimated 40% of the migrants in Italy have a valid claim to asylum or leave to remain on humanitarian grounds, AFP news agency reported.
The others are deemed to be illegal economic migrants and face deportation, but this can be difficult to arrange in practice because their countries of origin sometimes refuse to take them back.
A note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.","The mayor of Rome, who is from the anti-establishment Five Star Movement, has asked Italy's government not to send more migrants to the city.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"The Direct Energie rider took advantage of a lapse in concentration from Team Sky's Nicolas Roche to beat the Irishman in a sprint finish.
Roche was also second in the overall standings, six seconds behind Voeckler.
Bury's Adam Yates (Orica) was Britain's highest finisher, as he was third in the stage and fourth overall.
Sunday's final stage, a 198km route from Middlesbrough to Scarborough, contained six categorised climbs.
Team Sky set a punishing pace in wet and gruelling conditions after taking it on at half distance and with 44km to go they had five riders at the head of the leading group.
Roche attacked on the ascent at Harwood Dale and took with them Voeckler, Yates, Anthony Turgis (Cofidis) and Steven Kruijswijk (LottoNL).
It was Voeckler who clung on the to back of Roche as the Team Sky sprinter attacked again in the descent into Scarborough.
Voeckler, who finished third last year after missing out in a sprint finish, used that experience to employ some cat and mouse tactics, as he tracked Roche along the resort's seafront in front of huge crowds on the town's famous grass banks.
Roche suffered a momentary lapse in concentration, causing him to look the wrong way as Voeckler flew past him with the finishing line in sight to leave his rival in his wake.
Voeckler told ITV4: ""It wasn't just with the strength in my legs that I used, but also my head.
""It was difficult to follow the attack of Team Sky at the climbs, so I decided on a little more patience.
""Then I knew to launch the sprint at 300 metres. Although it was early, with the wind at my back, it was not so bad.""
And in a tribute to the Yorkshire public that came out in huge numbers despite persistent drizzle, he added: ""I feel like this is home because the crowd were shouting my name.""

"Research from the Institute for Policy Studies found that in 2014, bonuses paid to Wall Street employees had been double the annual pay earned by all Americans who worked full-time at the federal minimum wage.
So, 167,800 Wall Street employees were paid $28.5bn (£18.2bn) in bonuses, while 1,007,000 full-time minimum wage earners made about $14bn.
One particularly eye-catching blog on the subject carried the headline: ""If You Own a Pitchfork, You Will Grab It When You See This Chart"".
I wondered if this statistic was also true in the UK.
The best proxy we have for the Wall Street bonus pool is the ONS figure for bonuses paid in the finance and insurance sector, the most recent figure for which was £14.4bn in the financial year 2013-14.
The Low Pay Commission says that excluding apprenticeships there were 1.3 million jobs in 2014 that paid the National Minimum Wage (NMW) of which 40% were full-time, so that's about 520,000 jobs.
Assuming everyone earned the highest level of minimum wage, the average level of the NMW for 2013-14 was £6.25.
If we assume that they worked 37.5 hours a week (that's the average number of full-time hours given in the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings for 2014) and that they work 48 weeks a year, their total earnings come to £5.9bn, which is less than half the amount paid in bonuses by the finance and insurance sector - it's about 40%.
Before you go and buy a pitchfork, remember that there are differences between this figure and the US one. For example, the bonuses in the UK finance and insurance sector were shared between more than a million employees - considerably more than on Wall Street. There were people paid very high bonuses but also people paid much more modest ones. The average overall was £13,300, but I would expect that to mask quite a range.
But the other question is, what is this an indicator for and what would make it rise or fall?
So, for example, imagine that 100,000 people earning minimum wage suddenly received a pay rise of £1 an hour. They would no longer be earning minimum wage, so the total amount paid to workers on the minimum wage would fall considerably and as a result the amount paid out in bonuses would be a higher multiple of it. But it would be hard to argue that their pay rise had increased inequality.
Nonetheless, if you were outraged by the figure from the US then you will be just as outraged that the same appears to be true in the UK.",A statistic in March provoked outrage in the US media about inequality.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The force said mental health issues resulted in 141,230 lost days among front-line officers.
The Liberal Democrats said the figures showed evidence of a force ""being stretched to breaking point"".
The Scottish government said the welfare of officers and support staff was taken ""very seriously"".
Police Scotland released the figures to the Lib Dems under Freedom of Information laws.
The party's justice spokesman Liam McArthur said police officers and civilian staff were not getting the support they needed from the Scottish government.
He said: ""The savings that were promised by the SNP before the creation of Police Scotland have not materialised.
""As a result, officers and civilian staff are being asked to do more and more with less. With the chief constable warning that further cuts are coming, the pressure on staff is only likely to get worse.""
He added: ""We have already seen staff surveys which show morale is at rock bottom. The shortages are affecting the health of officers and civilian staff and these new figures are a huge concern.
""Policing is a high-stress profession at the best of times. The changes that the SNP forced through are stretching the mental health of officers and civilian staff to breaking point.

"Current Yes keyboardist Geoff Downes tweeted: ""Utterly devastated beyond words to have to report the sad news of the passing of my dear friend, bandmate and inspiration Chris Squire.""
Squire had revealed he was suffering from a rare form of leukaemia.

""It's with the heaviest of hearts and unbearable sadness that we must inform you of the passing of our dear friend and Yes co-founder, Chris Squire,"" a statement on the band's official Facebook page said.
Squire had revealed in May that he had been recently diagnosed with acute erythroid leukemia, which would force him to miss the band's summer co-headlining tour with Toto.
Yes were formed in 1968 when singer Jon Anderson met self-taught bassist Squire in London.
Their big break came a year later when they signed to Atlantic Records after opening for Janis Joplin at London's Royal Albert Hall. Their debut single, Sweetness, and first album, Yes, were released later that year.
Other albums included 1971's Fragile, 1972's Close To The Edge and 1977's Going For The One.
In 1983 they released the album 90125, which featured their classic hit Owner Of A Lonely Heart. That went on to become a US number one hit in January 1984 despite only reaching number 28 in their home country.
Squire also released a solo album, Fish Out Of Water, in 1975.

""Whether you are a kit man, doctor or secretary on the bench you have to understand the game.

Chelsea were already struggling to cope against Swansea's extra man before Hazard was tripped by Gylfi Sigurdsson with six minutes remaining, leading to Mourinho's frustration.
It was an eventful match for Premier League champions Chelsea. Courtois suffered an injury scare in the warm-up before he was was dismissed in the 52nd minute after bringing down Swansea striker Bafetimbi Gomis.
Replacement goalkeeper Asmir Begovic came on for his debut after an £8m move from Stoke, with opening goalscorer Oscar making way. Gomis scored the resulting penalty.

"Last year, Beijing banned any more ""bizarre"" buildings. In recent years the country has seen buildings shaped like a teapot and another resembling a pair of trousers.
Now, China's State Administration for Industry and Commerce has continued the government's crusade for normalcy with restrictions on such names as 'scared of wife' or 'prehistoric powers'.
So, just how weird and wonderful are Chinese company names? Well, a few otherwise-unoccupied social media users in China have dug up some gems.
Some curiosities have crept into business names from internet memes.
""Shenyang Prehistoric Powers Hotel Management Limited Company"" might sound weird but less so to Chinese sports fans who remember swimmer Fu Yuanhui.
She famously won a bronze medal at the Rio Olympics, afterwards declaring: ""I have used all my prehistoric powers to swim!""
There are also lots of restaurants and cafes with the phrase ""skinny blue mushroom"".
The phrase originated from a meme which mocked a man from Guangxi province who uploaded a video of himself talking about his loneliness while his girlfriend was away.
""Unbearable, I want to cry,"" he moaned - but thanks to his accent, it ended up sounding more like ""skinny blue mushroom"".
One of the best known offbeat names on Chinese social media is a condom company called ""Uncle Niu"".
Or, more accurately, ""There Is a Group of Young People With Dreams, Who Believe They Can Make the Wonders of Life Under the Leadership of Uncle Niu Internet Technology Co Ltd.""
It's not concise, but at least it's positive.
Others aren't so upbeat, especially when it comes to home life.
And given ""Beijing Scared of Wife Technology Company"" and ""Anping County Scared of Wife Netting Products Factory"" are both registered companies, the trend doesn't seem to be limited by industry or region.
The rules of written Chinese are vastly different to those of written English, so many names seem far stranger in translation than in the original tongue.
English names can seem pretty strange in Chinese too, and there's a cottage industry among branding agencies to help western companies come up with names for the Chinese market.
Western company names often follow the name of their founder (think Boeing, Ford or Gucci), which might have no direct translation.
Or they might be a concocted portmanteau (think Verizon, which is the Latin word ""veritas"" meaning truth, with horizon bolted on to the end) or maybe even just tech nonsense (Etsy, Hulu).
""What we think is most important to come up with a name that captures the spirit of the brand,"" says Tait Lawton, from Nanjing Marketing Group, which provides naming services.
Western companies sometimes try to phonetically replicate the original, or come up with a Chinese name that's fairly neutral in meaning.
Others will come up with a new name that tries other ways of encapsulating the brand.
""BMW's current Chinese name is 宝马. It's great. The first character means 'treasure' and the second character means 'horse'. The sound is 'bao ma', starting with a B and M. Plus, it's short. It just has a great feel to it,"" says Mr Lawton.
He has a few other examples he likes too.
Pampers, for example, is 帮宝适 or ""bang bao shi"", which means ""helps make baby comfortable"".
Walch soap 威露士 or ""wei lu shi"" loosely translates as ""mighty liquid guard"", and who wouldn't want to wash with that?",China has banned companies from registering weird and long names.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ms Wilson, known also as Katherine, is the director of Zardozi, a charity which helps poor women start their own businesses.
She had been working in the region for 20 years before she was kidnapped by the unidentified gunmen.

In July, civil servants went on strike over delays in the payment of their salaries.
The country is going through its toughest economic situation since the hyper-inflation of 2008.
Speaking to parliament on Thursday, Finance Minister Patrick Chinamasa said that currently the government wage bill takes up nearly 97% of the revenue it receives.
He hopes to bring that figure down to 75% by the end of next year.
The 25,000 job losses, which amount to 8% of the civil service workforce, were described in the state-owned Herald newspaper as a ""bold measure"" to reduce ""unsustainable"" spending.
Last year, Mr Chinamasa made similar proposals which were then blocked by the cabinet.
In the past few months, the government has struggled to pay civil servants' wages including those of soldiers, teachers and health workers.
The delay led to one of the biggest strikes the country has witnessed in years, in July.

"Henry Ramos Allup, 72, will be the first opposition politician to lead the National Assembly in 16 years following a landslide victory in legislative elections on 6 December.
Mr Ramos said he would ensure the assembly would act ""as an autonomous power.""
The newly elected lawmakers will take up their seats on Tuesday.
Mr Ramos Allup was chosen by opposition lawmakers in a secret ballot with 69 votes out of 111 cast, defeating 46-year-old Julio Borges of the Justice First party.
He is expected to be formally confirmed in the post when the lawmakers take up their seats.
Mr Ramos Allup is the secretary general of the social-democratic Democratic Action party, which has long been opposing the socialist government of President Nicolas Maduro and his predecessor in office, Hugo Chavez.
The government says Mr Ramos Allup is a member of Venezuela's ""old guard"". His Democratic Action was one of two parties that alternated in power for four decades before President Hugo Chavez was elected president in 1998.
But his supporters say the 72-year-old has the experience and political savvy to turn the National Assembly into a counterbalance to President Maduro's executive branch.
Mr Ramos Allup said the MUD opposition coalition, which won a two-thirds majority in the National Assembly, would show Venezuelans ""a more democratic way forward"".
Known for his sometimes confrontational style, he struck a surprisingly conciliatory note after his election.
""We represent an alternative. We are not going to be anti-establishment, rather an autonomous legislative power,"" he said.
""We ask people to watch us, to demand more of us, and keep an eye on what we do to make sure we honour our commitment,"" he added.

"Aqsa Mahmood, 20, travelled to Syria from her Glasgow home to become a ""Jihadi bride"" in November 2013.
The Daily Mail reported she had been in touch with at least one of the three London girls, who are aged 15 and 16.
The trio are thought to have flown to Turkey in an attempt to enter Syria.
Shamima Begum, 15, Kadiza Sultana, 16,  and an unnamed 15-year-old girl, who all attended Bethnal Green Academy in Tower Hamlets, travelled to Turkey on Tuesday.
They were interviewed by police after another girl from their school went to Syria in December but were not considered as a risk.
In a statement released through their lawyer Aamer Anwar, the Mahmood family said they were ""full of horror and anger that their daughter may have had a role to play in the recruitment of these young girls to Isis"".
They also sent a message to Aqsa: ""You are a disgrace to your family and the people of Scotland, your actions are a perverted and evil distortion of Islam.
""You are killing your family every day with your actions, they are begging you stop if you ever loved them.""
The statement also said the UK security services had questions to answer.
It added: ""Aqsa's social media has been monitored since she disappeared over a year ago, yet despite alleged contact between the girls and Aqsa, they failed to stop them from leaving the UK for Turkey, a staging post for Syria.
""Sadly, despite all the government's rhetoric on Isis, if they can't even take basic steps to stop children leaving to join Isis, what is the point of any new laws?""

"Eight Type 26 frigates are due to be built on the Clyde, but the UK government has not announced a timescale for the project.
Harriet Baldwin faced calls from SNP and Labour MPs to confirm a time-frame for cutting steel on the frigates.
But she said it would be ""inappropriate"" to do so as negotiations continue.
Work had originally been due to start this year, but SNP defence spokesman Brendan O'Hara predicted during a Commons debate on Tuesday that construction of the ships would not start until at least the summer of next year.
He also said the delays could be in part blamed on the economic impact of Brexit, as well as the government committing too much of its procurement budget to renewing the Trident nuclear deterrent.
Mr O'Hara told MPs: ""It would be an unforgivable betrayal of the Clyde workers if they were the ones that had to pay the price of Brexit, but also the price of Trident.""
In reply, Ms Baldwin told the Westminster Hall debate: ""The timing of the award of the build contract and the build schedule itself are key components of the ongoing commercial negotiations between the Government and BAE Systems.
""We are negotiating a deal that aims to optimise the requirements of the Royal Navy in terms of the capability the ships will deliver, to achieve value for money for defence and the taxpayer, and to deliver a build schedule that drives performance.
""These negotiations are continuing, so I am not this afternoon in a position to give a specific date as to when an agreement will be reached.
""To protect the commercial interests of the Ministry of Defence, disclosing any such detail would be inappropriate at this time.""
Under questioning from the SNP's Chris Stephens, Ms Baldwin confirmed the national ship building strategy will report by the time of the Autumn Statement on 23 November, which could reveal fresh information about plans for the Type 26 frigates.
Ms Baldwin also resisted calls to disclose further reasons behind delays and cuts to the project.
The project has already been cut from 13 to eight new ships, while a target to start cutting steel in May has been delayed indefinitely.
Tory MP Bob Stewart, a former British Army officer, said: ""I don't think we need the minister to answer that - the answer is we had no money.
""That's why we had to cut down the number of Type 26 ships. We did not have the money, and we actually had to cut our means to suit our coat.""

"The role is widely regarded as the biggest job in British theatre, and Norris called it ""a great honour"".
""I am thrilled at the challenge of leading this exceptional organisation, where it has been a privilege to work under the inspirational leadership of Nick Hytner,"" he said.
Sir Nicholas announced last April he would step down in March 2015.
Norris first came to prominence in 2001 with his production of Afore Night Come at the Young Vic, for which he won the Evening Standard award for most promising newcomer.
Having initially trained at Rada as an actor, the 48-year-old has since directed theatre in the West End and on Broadway, as well as having experience with opera and film.
In 2012 his film Broken premiered at the Cannes Film Festival before winning best British independent film at the British Independent Film Awards.
He recently directed The Amen Corner at the National and also created Dr Dee: An English Opera with Blur frontman Damon Albarn for the Manchester International Festival in 2011.
Earlier this year he also launched the National's temporary Shed venue on London's Southbank with Table, by his playwright wife Tanya Ronder.
""The National is an extraordinary place full of extraordinary people and I look forward with relish to the task ahead,"" Norris said.
""That being to fill our theatres with the most exciting, accessible and ground-breaking work our unique and broad community of artists has to offer.""
Sir Nicholas will have spent 12 years as the National Theatre's director when he hands over to Norris in 2015.
He has overseen worldwide hits such as The History Boys, War Horse and One Man, Two Guvnors, as well as NT Live which screens theatre productions in cinemas.
He said his successor would be ""welcomed with great excitement both within the National and in the theatre at large"".
He added: ""His work as a director is always searching, deeply considered and adventurous and I have no doubt he will bring these qualities to the running of the National.""
Sir Nicholas said Norris received a standing ovation from the National Theatre company when he had introduced him earlier, accompanied by a huge roar ""even louder than when old Alfie falls down the stairs in One Man, Two Guvnors"".
Norris said his new role was ""a great privilege and I will attack that with gusto"", adding he would like to ""cast the net wider"" in terms of who would perform at the theatre.

""He fits the bill. There are certain echoes between him and Hytner which no doubt appealed to the board.
""The main thing is that neither of them, upon being appointed, had run buildings before. They both enjoyed stellar careers as freelance directors which, firstly, indicates the board wants to have an artist at the head rather than a career artistic director and, secondly, they want someone with new ideas.
""He's had a fascinating career. Festen at the Almeida (2004) was a stellar production and proved that work fostered in a subsidised theatre could transfer to the commercial West End.
""The key with him is that he can direct at the Olivier (The Amen Corner, London Road, Death and the King's Horseman) and on a smaller scale at The Shed (Table).
""He's proved he has the ability to direct across the board.""

""The theatre's in a different place from when Nick [Hytner] took over - a position of strength.""
Norris revealed he was directing a movie version of London Road in 2014, but said he would be ""100% committed to this building"" from the moment Sir Nicholas leaves.
""I'm not going to kid myself. I will be chained to this place,"" he added.
Norris, who has been an associate director at the National Theatre since 2011, will take up his new position from April 2015.
He is the first former actor as well as non-Oxbridge graduate to be appointed since Sir Laurence Olivier, who was the National's first artistic director in 1963.
""There have been many times in my life when I've regretted that I played in bands and was a painter decorator for four years when I could have been at university, but I seem to be here - it worked out,"" Norris said.
""The simple fact is, lots of people who go to Oxford and Cambridge are very, very clever. That doesn't mean they're the only clever people.""
The National Theatre's chairman John Makinson said: ""The Board looked for an individual with a creative reputation that would command the respect and support of British theatre, and with the generosity of spirit that has characterised Nick Hytner's period as director.
""Rufus Norris has both those qualities in abundance. He is an exciting choice, someone who will build on the National Theatre's present reputation as one of the most admired and innovative performing arts organisations in the world.
""We are fortunate that he has chosen to join us.""
The National Theatre's first director from 1963-73 was Sir Laurence Olivier, who is widely considered to be one of the greatest actors of all time.
When asked by the BBC's Arts Editor Will Gompertz whether he thought his acting past would also bring a different flavour to the institution, Norris laughed: ""It's an interesting question and one I had not anticipated at all, because to compare me as an actor with Laurence Olivier is one of the funniest things I've heard in a long time.""
He continued: ""I'm sure that what I bring to it will be nothing like the amount of skill and expertise that his acting career allowed him to bring to the table.
""But I think, yeah, training as an actor and having that experience for a while gives you an insight into a certain aspect of the process which is very, very useful.""
Sir Kenneth Branagh, Stephen Daldry, Danny Boyle and ex-Donmar Warehouse bosses Michael Grandage and Sam Mendes had all been in the frame for the job, although Mendes had ruled himself out of the race.
Nick Starr, the theatre's executive director since 2002, also announced he would be leaving the NT during 2014, leading to a phased handover of the top jobs.",Rufus Norris is to take over from Sir Nicholas Hytner as director of the National Theatre.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The five-year civil war between the Moscow-backed government and the Islamist-led opposition, in which up to 50,000 people were killed and over one-tenth of the population fled the country, ended in 1997 with a United Nations-brokered peace agreement.
Tajikistan's economy has never really recovered from the civil war, and poverty is widespread. Almost half of GDP is earned by migrants working abroad, especially in Russia, but the recession in 2009 threatened that income. The country is also dependent on oil and gas imports.
Economic hardship is seen as a contributing to a renewed interest in Islam - including more radical forms - among young Tajiks.
Tajikistan has been accused by its neighbours of tolerating the presence of training camps for Islamist rebels on its territory, an accusation which it has strongly denied.
Tajikistan has relied heavily on Russian assistance to counter continuing security problems and cope with the dire economic situation. Skirmishes with drug smugglers crossing illegally from Afghanistan occur regularly, as Tajikistan is the first stop on the drugs route from there to Russia and the West.
Russia maintains military garrisons in Tajikistan and in 2004 took back control over a former Soviet space monitoring centre. These developments were widely seen as a sign of Russia's wish to counter increased US influence in Central Asia.

"She was 12 at the time and living with her parents and two siblings in northern Peru.
On that night, two officials came to their home and took away her father.
Mr Katsura, who owned a small general store, was arrested because he was part of Peru's prosperous Japanese community.
""My father told them he hadn't done anything wrong, but they didn't listen to him,"" she recalls.
Japanese people began migrating to Peru in considerable numbers at the end of the 19th Century, drawn by opportunities to work in the mines and on sugar plantations.
By the 1940s, an estimated 25,000 people of Japanese descent lived in Peru. Many had become lawyers and doctors, or owned small businesses.
Their prosperity, further fuelled by racism, soon triggered anti-Japanese sentiment in Peru, Stephanie Moore explains.
Ms Moore, a scholar at the Japanese Peruvian Oral History Project, says after the outbreak of World War Two, the Japanese community in Peru became a target, and their assets were confiscated.
""In May 1940, as many as 600 houses, schools and businesses belonging to citizens of Japanese descent were burned down,"" she says.
Following Japan's 1941 attack on the US naval base at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii, the US government asked a dozen Latin American countries, among them Peru, to arrest its Japanese residents.
Records from the time suggest the US authorities wanted to take them to the US and use them as bargaining chips for its nationals captured by Japanese forces in Asia.
Mr Katsura was among the 2,200 Latin Americans of Japanese descent who were forcibly deported to internment camps in the US.
Blanca Katsura, who is now 83 and lives in Northern California, remembers how she learned of his fate.
""A month after my father was detained, he sent me a letter because it was my birthday,"" she recalls.
""He had been taken to Panama from where they were planning to send him to the US,"" she adds.
Six months later, Blanca Katsura's mother decided to take her three small children to the US to search for her husband.
""When we arrived in New Orleans after a month-long trip, they confiscated our passports and then sent us by train to the Crystal City camp.""
As many as 4,000 people were interned during World War Two in this camp in Texas run by the US Immigration and Naturalization Service.
Most of the detainees were of Japanese descent, although some German and Italian immigrants were also held there.
It was at Crystal City that Blanca Katsura was reunited with her father. ""I was shocked, he had lost so much weight,"" she remembers.
For the next four years, her family lived in the barracks at the camp.
Her memories of that time are not particularly traumatic, she says.
""Being a child at the time time, I had no worries and made lots of friends.
""We were able to go to school and learn Japanese,"" she adds.
Ms Katsura says she later learned that the camp authorities were keen for the children to learn Japanese so they would be able to speak the language once they were deported to Japan.
Chieko Kamisato's memories of life at Crystal City are less positive.
""You could call it a concentration camp, because we were surrounded by barbed wire fences and guards with guns,"" she says.
""We couldn't go out at all, although we were free to move around inside,"" she recalls.
""My parents were really bitter about the situation because they were forced to come to the US. They had no choice,"" she says.
Ms Kamisato's father had moved to Peru from Japan in 1915 and had worked hard to open a bakery in the capital, Lima.
Now 81, she lives in Los Angeles.
Of the 2,200 Latin Americans of Japanese descent to be interned in the US, 800 were sent to Japan as part of prisoner exchanges.
After World War Two ended, another 1,000 were deported to Japan after their Latin American home countries refused to take them back.
Ms Katsura's and Ms Kamisato's families successfully fought deportation and were eventually allowed to remain in the US.
In 1988, then-President Ronald Reagan signed the Civil Liberties Act and apologised on behalf of the US government for the internment of Japanese-Americans.
Under the act, the government paid tens of thousands of survivors of the camps $20,000 (Â£13,000) each in reparation.
But Japanese-Latin Americans did not qualify for the payments because they had not been US citizens or permanent residents of the US at the time of their internment.
Outraged, they filed a class-action suit and 10 years later, the US government agreed to pay them $5,000 each.
Most accepted, but a small group headed by camp survivor Art Shibayama decided to hold out, demanding to be paid the same as Japanese-Americans.
Blanca Katsura says that even though her childhood at the camp may not have been traumatic, no amount of money can compensate her family for its loss.
""My parents wanted to go back to Peru but couldn't. They missed the life they had there,"" she recalls.
""The Peruvian government sold us out to the US government and that is not a very nice feeling. How would you feel about it?""",Blanca Katsura will never forget the night of 6 January 1943.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"John Griffith-Jones was asked at a Treasury Select Committee hearing whether the Treasury had leant on the FCA or undermined its independence.
He said that the ""simple answer"" was ""no to both"".
Acting chief executive Tracey McDermott said the suggestion was ""nonsense"".
Two senior FCA figures were speaking at a committee hearing called after it emerged that the inquiry, described as a ""thematic review"", had been scrapped.
The FCA had planned to look at whether pay, promotion or other incentives had contributed to scandals involving banks in the UK and abroad.
Ms McDermott told the committee the review had been shelved because ""we didn't think that we would be able to put out something that was sufficiently useful or valuable to make it worthwhile spending resources and time on doing it"".
She said the review would have duplicated other work carried out elsewhere, notably by the Banking Standards Board, which was ""looking at precisely the same issue"".
She said the FCA was now seeking to ""build on work done by other bodies"" and would be focusing on individual firms through regulatory supervision.
Banks around the world have faced huge fines from regulators for their involvement in numerous scandals.
In May last year, the news agency Reuters calculated that 20 global banks had paid Â£152bn in fines and compensation to customers since the 2008 financial crisis.","The chairman of the City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), has said political considerations played no part in its decision to shelve an inquiry into the culture of banking.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Beforehand the party had been linked for years to neo-Nazis and other extremist groups.
In a speech in August, he identified himself as a nationalist but called for his party to show they were ""broad and inclusive"".

The anti-immigration rhetoric has been toned down and carefully argued, with a policy of preferring to help refugees in their own countries.
There are obvious parallels with France's National Front which, under the leadership of Marine Le Pen, has moved into the political mainstream.
The two parties go back many years, and Ms Le Pen visited Jimmie Akesson last year in Stockholm. A few months ago he praised the National Front's ""modern, quite fresh direction"".
That does not mean the Sweden Democrats have shaken off their past but, with two MEPs in the European Parliament, they are now part of the same grouping as the Eurosceptic UK Independence Party - the Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy group.
Swedish voters are attracted to the party, more because it gives a voice to people who dislike the political elite than its stance on immigration, Prof Bjereld believes.
And although he argues that party membership will always have a racist element, the main stance is more xenophobic than racist.
""One of Jimmie Akesson's skills is that he sends one message to the racists in his party and another to the general public.""","They see themselves as the kingmakers of Swedish politics and, after polling 13% in national elections, the far-right Sweden Democrats are now difficult for mainstream parties to ignore.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Hills Quarry Products has submitted a planning application to the county council for a sand and gravel quarry near the village of Clifton Hampden.
It said the development, known as Fullamoor Quarry, will see 2.5m tonnes of earth extracted over 10 years.
But residents said the plan poses a threat ""to the health and wellbeing"" of their communities.
Chairman of campaign group Bachport (Burcot and Clifton Hampden Protection of the River Thames) Ian Mason said: ""It's vital that people express their deep concerns.
""A quarry would devastate a tranquil part of the Oxford Green Belt bordering the Thames and we fear more flooding as the proposed site is in the flood plain.""
He added that the biggest concern was the traffic a quarry would generate, with 570 lorry movements a week.
Hills Quarry Products director Peter Andrew said the application followed an 18-month public consultation, which included meetings with residents.
He said: ""As a result of the feedback received, we significantly reduced our plans in relation to the volumes of material we hope to extract and the time we will take to work the site.
""The final restoration plans were also scaled back so that no additional material is brought on to site, which in turn reduced the overall number of vehicle movements.""
In a statement the company said the proposed quarry covers an area of 104 hectares, of which 76 hectares will be worked.

"Police said Alexandria Hollinghurst, 17, and Brandon Goode, 18, wrote what appeared to be suicide notes.
The notes were recovered before the pair were found dead in undergrowth on Saturday.
The head teacher of Miss Hollinghurst's former primary school in Derbyshire said she was a ""talented pupil"".
Her family had emigrated to the US six years ago.
Orange County Sheriff's Office said the couple had been reported as ""missing endangered due to the suicidal notes"" in the hours before the shooting.
A police spokesman said: ""Goode and Hollinghurst are now officially considered suspects in the homicide of Officer Robert German.
""While Goode and Hollinghurst died of what is believed to be gunshot wounds from apparent suicide, we are awaiting the medical examiner's findings for the exact cause of death.""

When colleagues arrived they discovered Officer German ""mortally wounded"" with a gunshot injury and he was later pronounced dead at Orlando Regional Medical Centre.
At the same time, gunshots were heard nearby and the bodies of Miss Hollinghurst and Mr Goode were discovered a short distance away, police said.
Miss Hollinghurst and her family previously lived in the Derbyshire village of Hadfield.

"The Coseley School in Dudley has 557 pupils - just over half its 975 capacity - and last year's GCSE results placed it bottom in the borough.
About 100 people protested outside Dudley Council house on Monday as the decision was made to put the closure plan to the public.
The consultation will run until 5 April, with a decision due in May.
'Safe haven'
If the plan goes ahead, years seven, eight and nine will go to different schools next year.
Current year 10's would stay and complete their GCSE's with the school shutting altogether in August 2017.
Head girl Tatiana Davies protested with fellow pupils against the closure.
She said: ""This place is like a safe haven for kids and it's a community that's being ripped apart by the council.
""It's not fair whatsoever that they've made a decision to do this... We care about our school so much.""
Councillor Ian Cooper, cabinet member for children's services, said: ""Proposing the closure of the school is very much the last resort and not something we have taken lightly.
""During recent years it has experienced a dramatic decline in pupil numbers, which are forecast to drop even more over the next three years, as well as results below the national minimum standards.
""We know the school has worked hard to try and raise attainment but unfortunately all these factors have led us to take this action.""

Last year, Ascend supported a team of 13 women climbed three peaks over 16,000 feet, including one previously unclimbed mountain which they subsequently named.

"The four-piece group and their manager, who were aged between 19 and 32, died in the early hours of 13 February following a gig in Stockholm.
Their car crashed into a raised section of a bridge and plummeted into a canal.
The inquest heard no alcohol or drugs was found in the blood of manager Craig Tarry, 32, who was driving.
Post-mortem examinations also showed the four band members had not taken drugs and had only consumed small amounts of alcohol.
The band's agent Graham Bennett told the inquest at Warrington Coroner's Court that the up-and-coming group were in Sweden for a festival showcasing young artists.
Viola Beach had already played at the Reading and Leeds festivals last year and the Stockholm event was their first gig outside the UK.
After the performance, they were travelling in a black Nissan Qashqai near the SÃ¶dertÃ¤lje Canal, about 18 miles from the capital, when a bridge was raised to let a boat pass underneath.
The inquest heard that the car was slightly over the speed limit as it was travelling at 108km/h (67mph) in a 100km/h zone.
Flashing lights signalled that the bridge was about to be raised with the middle section of the road lifted horizontally, the inquest heard.
Mr Tarry drove down a verge past stationary queuing traffic and through the first set of barriers, about 120m from the bridge, the court heard.
The car then travelled in a ""controlled manner"" at between 70 and 90km/h down the centre of the road.
It continued through a second set of barriers - 30m from the drop into the canal - and hit the raised section of the bridge before plummeting 25m, hitting the water within 15 seconds.
The court heard a tanker using the canal, which had requested the bridge to be lifted, then passed over the crash spot and ""contact"" with the car could not be ruled out.
The crew of a passing boat saw the car fall but initially thought it was ice.
Technical examinations did not find any errors with the car, barrier system or the procedure for raising the bridge.
One warning light on the bridge was out of order but there were at least 10 warning lights and flashing signals, the inquest heard.
Although the road was wet, it was not frozen with ice.
Post-mortem examinations found that all died from head injuries apart from Mr Lowe whose cause of death was given as drowning.
The court heard that the three band members sitting in the back of the car were not wearing seatbelts but those in the front were, and had to be cut from the vehicle.
Cheshire Coroner Nicholas Rheinberg said ""none of the young men will have suffered"" as they died.
The Swedish authorities have recommended improvements to the crossing, including LED signs and cameras on the bridge.
In the wake of their deaths, the band's first single Swings & Waterslides reached number 11, while their song Boys That Sing was performed by Coldplay in a tribute at Glastonbury.
Posthumously, Viola Beach scored a number one album in August.

"The new rates will be implemented in October and will benefit a million workers.
Business Secretary Vince Cable said he had accepted a recommendation from the Low Pay Commission that the minimum wage should increase by 3%.
It is the first time in six years that the rise will be higher than inflation.
The rate for 18 to 20-year-olds will go up by 10p to £5.13 an hour, a 2% increase.
The rate for those aged 16 and 17 will rise by 7p to £3.79, also a 2% rise.
Apprentices will earn an extra 5p an hour, taking their wages to at least £2.73.
The consumer prices index (CPI) rate of inflation is currently 1.9%.
""The recommendations I have accepted today mean that low-paid workers will enjoy the biggest cash increase in their take-home pay since 2008,"" said Mr Cable.
He also suggested that all companies should consider helping their staff to share in the fruits of an improving economy.
""I urge businesses to consider how all their staff - not just those on the minimum wage - can enjoy the benefits of recovery,"" he said.
Meanwhile, the man who set up the minimum wage 15 years ago, said it is in need of major reform.
Professor Sir George Bain, founding chair of the Low Pay Commission, said the benchmark was a ""child of its times"" when launched in 1999.
But speaking to BBC Newsnight on Wednesday, he said it had become a ""blunt instrument"" and that many employers could now afford to pay their workers much more.
""If you set it at the 'living wage', which is about £7.65 an hour, you would cause massive unemployment in areas like retail and social care,"" Sir George added.
""But there's only about five sectors where this is true. There's a whole range of sectors where you could easily afford to pay more than the minimum wage.""
Sir George, who has chaired a review of the minimum wage for think-tank the Resolution Foundation, also said there should be a ""special case for London to have a higher national minimum"".
His report also recommends that the Low Pay Commission give longer-term forecasts for the benchmark, to help employers plan for the future.
The latest rise means the national minimum wage is still well below the definition of low pay, as set by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).
This equates to two-thirds of the median full-time hourly wage - about £7.71 an hour. About five million UK workers currently earn below that level.
The latest figure is also well below the living wage, which is £8.80 per hour in London, and £7.65 in the rest of the country.
""Across the country, people are struggling to make ends meet,"" said Dave Prentice, the head of the Unison trade union.
""The sooner we move to a living wage, the better,"" he said.
In January this year, Chancellor George Osborne said he backed the idea of the national minimum wage reaching £7 an hour by October 2015.
The latest announcement could pave the way for that to happen, but it would need a rise of more than 7% next year to do so.
Unite, the country's biggest trade union, said the rise announced was ""timid"".
""To make matters even worse, George Osborne cruelly held out hope that the rate would rise to £7,"" said Len McCluskey, Unite's general secretary.
""The government claims it is on the side of working people but companies are sitting on a cash mountain of £500bn and they should be forced to share more of it with the lowest paid,"" he added.","The national minimum wage will increase by 19p an hour to £6.50, the government has announced.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But with the lowest turnout in the constituency's history and a margin of 2,620 the narrowest ever recorded in this once proud Labour heartland, can this declaration really be believed?
It's a bright and windy day in Stoke-on-Trent.
The town has been at the centre of the political spotlight for weeks now, but people seem more interested in discussing the aftermath of Storm Doris than the small matter of Stoke Central's by-election result.
This staunch working class community was once passionately behind Labour.
In 1951, more than 60,000 went to the polls - 34,260 backing Labour.
Rather than feel victorious about Gareth Snell's win, Labour voters willing to talk simply seem relieved Paul Nuttall didn't clinch it.
In all, 7,853 voted for Mr Snell, compared to 5,233 who wanted UKIP to win.
Wendy Wright, 51, from Newcastle-under-Lyme, thought the vote for UKIP may have been higher had it not been for its disastrous campaign.
""I'm not surprised Labour won because of the way UKIP handled the campaign,"" she said.
""The people of Stoke seemed to think he [Paul Nuttall] didn't come from the area and they didn't believe his pack of lies.
""It's a relief UKIP didn't get in but [Labour retaining the seat] just means things are going to stay the same.""
Ms Wright said there had not been a high turnout because ""people aren't interested in politics"".
She said: ""They've kind of lost faith and lost hope. They think, what's the point, nothing's going to change.
""It's a deprived area and it's a shame because the people are so welcoming and friendly.""
Veronica Millington, 71, from Blythe Bridge, said she and husband Anthony, 75, were ""Labour through and through"".
They backed Mr Snell in the by-election and also voted to stay in the European Union.
""I think the people of Stoke do care about politics and they want to make things better,"" she said.
""I think they were misled by UKIP in the beginning. They seemed to promise them so much and people saw it as a new chance really.
""It was only when all the lies came out they saw how many wrong things had been said.""
Mr Millington, 75, expressed concern about why so few people bothered to go to the polls.
""The turnout seemed to be very low and I think a lot of people think it was a foregone conclusion.
""They thought the Labour Party would win. Now whether or not they've had a jolt from the outsider now, I don't know.""
For a city that has had such a strong relationship with the Labour party, the changing political landscape over the past seven decades reveals a lot about the strength of feeling in the community.
Labour has won all 18 elections since since the inception of the Stoke Central constituency, with the Conservatives coming second until 2001.
But although Labour enjoyed a heyday in the 1960s and 70s, their share of the vote has consistently fallen over the years down to a record low of 37% in this by-election.
So why did this city of proud, working class voters fall out of love with Labour?
""Things started to change because of a growing alienation of the people of Stoke-on-Trent from Westminster,"" says Prof Mick Temple from Staffordshire University.
""Industry was decimated in the 1980s - coal, steel and the Potteries.
""When I first came here [in the early 90s] infrastructure was poor, schools were poor and still today, unemployment is higher than the national average.""
From the closure of Shelton Steel Works - where 10,000 once worked - to the shrinking of its famous pottery industry, the people of Stoke-on-Trent have lived through some turbulent times.
But the bleak images of derelict factories and houses often shown by the media are not a true reflection of the passion and pride of a community that is fiercely proud of its heritage.
Data shows 6.2% of adults in Stoke Central claim unemployment benefit, far higher than the national average of 3.8%.
In recent years employers such as Bet365, Michelin Tyres and Goodwin have invested millions of pounds into their businesses, providing jobs for thousands of people.
Hanley's famous pottery industry is also enjoying something of a resurgence, with Emma Bridgewater investing more than Â£1m in its thriving ceramics factory.
Middleport Pottery, home of world-famous Burleigh, is in the national spotlight thanks to the success of BBC Two's The Great Pottery Throw Down.
Millions of pounds are being spent regenerating the city.
For many people though, the investment has been too little, too late.
""The feeling is that the city has been passed by Westminster and the EU, and that is why people voted Leave so overwhelmingly,"" says Prof Temple.
""There are many towns in the north of England where people feel the same - areas that are ripe for UKIP.""
From 2005, the BNP and UKIP began to resonate with voters, coming fourth and fifth in that year's election and again in 2010.
By 2015, UKIP had won so much support its candidate Mick Harold came second to Tristram Hunt for a seat that had the lowest voter turnout in the whole of the UK.
Pub owner Tony Flackett, 69, backed Paul Nuttall in Thursday's poll.
""It feels sad, it's such a shame, they've worked really hard and people have come from all over the country.
""I've always voted for Conservatives but the last two years I voted UKIP because of Brexit and immigration.
""But life goes on and at least they reduced the margin.""
Tom Wilson, 26, voted for UKIP in the by-election and said he was ""very upset"" at the result.
""I think Labour winning is very bad news for Stoke-on-Trent.
""There has been years of neglect in Stoke with money spent only on Hanley.
""I think only UKIP would have made a change for the people of Stoke.""
UKIP has made moves to appeal to former Labour voters, as well as those who formerly backed the Tories.
""They're more pro-State, pro-NHS. They recognise that strong nationalistic message supported by the working class,"" says Prof Temple.
Between the 2001 and 2011 Censuses, the non-white population doubled and there was a relatively high population of Muslims, he said.
""I'm not saying the response was a racist one - Stoke-on-Trent was getting less and less money from the government and the EU and the feeling was the traditional working class community was being overtaken.
""Many working class voters felt they could not express their views within the Labour party.
""The BNP and UKIP gave them a chance to say how they felt.""
Now Mr Snell is the town's new MP, the challenge is on for him to win back the trust of former Labour supporters and engage with new ones.
Lee Woolrich, 33, from Stoke-on-Trent, is head of client services for a digital agency but did not vote in the by-election.
""I'm ashamed really that I didn't use my vote, but I almost don't think I invest enough in politics to make an informed decision,"" he said.
""I don't think young people are engaged in politics. I think they are more so recently because of what's happened in America.
""I read about Paul Nuttall and some of his views and policies and I don't believe it's what we need here.""
Mr Woolrich believes politicians need to take more of an interest in Stoke-on-Trent - he too feels the place has been forgotten and is badly represented by the media.
""Stoke is doing great without those kinds of ideas.
""I love the developments in Hanley and the cultural quarter.
""Stoke is showing signs of change and getting in line with cities like Manchester.
""On a local level, I like the direction things are going in but I don't necessarily think government in London will listen to the people of Stoke.
""I hate that stigma that Stoke isn't a nice place to live.
""It doesn't do the place justice. It's a beautiful city steeped in history.""
And Prof Temple agrees. ""It's a much more attractive place,"" he said.
""I've been here for 24 years, I've lived all around the world and this is the friendliest, most coherent community I've ever known.
""Stoke-on-Trent has an identity most places in the UK have lost.
""There's a very strong sense of community. It's a place where friendship and family is still strong.""","In the wake of his victory, Stoke Central's new Labour MP Gareth Snell claimed it had been a triumph for the ""politics of hope"".",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

""It's always a tough position as a kind of interim manager, especially with the way things have gone,"" on-loan Bournemouth midfielder Hyndman added.
""But I credit him for coming in and establishing what he wants us to do. I think the boys got behind him quite well.

And with the Premiership gap between third-placed Rangers and second-placed Aberdeen now cut to six points, USA international Hyndman says there is still plenty to play for this term.
""Of course there is,"" he said. ""We saw the Aberdeen result the other night (1-0 defeat at Hamilton) but we're just focused on ourselves at the same time.

"A report by technology news site Gizmodo said staff responsible for what was shown to Facebook's 1.6bn users frequently chose to bury articles they did not agree with.
Responding to the allegations, the network's head of search Tom Stocky wrote that the site ""found no evidence that the anonymous allegations are true"".
The claims come weeks after Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg publicly denounced the policies of likely US presidential nominee, Donald Trump.
""I hear fearful voices calling for building walls and distancing people they label as 'others.',"" the 31-year-old said at his firm's recent developers conference.
However, Facebook insisted Mr Zuckerberg's view did not influence what stories are given added visibility on the network.
The Trending Topics column appears in the top right corner of a typical Facebook page. It is designed to highlight what subjects are being discussed heavily by Facebook users around the world.
Facebook explained in a statement that this list was edited by humans so as to avoid regularly recurring popular topics - such as ""lunch"".
Facebook's Mr Stocky explained: ""Popular topics are first surfaced by an algorithm, then audited by review team members to confirm that the topics are in fact trending news in the real world and not, for example, similar-sounding topics or misnomers.""
The Gizmodo story, which quoted a person it said they had been one of the editors, alleged Facebook staff were routinely tampering with Trending Topic stories.
Gizmodo's source added that staff were told to seek out stories published on the BBC, CNN and other mainstream sites ahead of publications with a clearly stated political bias - even if the stories originated on those smaller outlets.
Also, if several mainstream media sites were covering the same story, Facebook would - according to the source - artificially place it in the Trending Topic column, even if it was not being discussed heavily by users.
Breitbart, one of the leading conservative news sources in the US, said the reports confirmed what they had ""long suspected"", that ""Facebook's trending news artificially mutes conservatives and amplifies progressives"".
The anonymous source also claimed that stories staff favoured - such as the Black Lives Matter movement - were given artificially greater prominence. Facebook said that this was ""untrue"".
After a day of growing reports across social media and in conservative-leaning publications, Facebook's Mr Stocky posted a response on his profile.
""We have in place strict guidelines for our trending topic reviewers as they audit topics surfaced algorithmically,"" he wrote.
""Reviewers are required to accept topics that reflect real world events, and are instructed to disregard junk or duplicate topics, hoaxes, or subjects with insufficient sources.
""Facebook does not allow or advise our reviewers to systematically discriminate against sources of any ideological origin and we've designed our tools to make that technically not feasible.
""At the same time, our reviewers' actions are logged and reviewed, and violating our guidelines is a fireable offense.""

"The 32-year-old midfielder had trained alone or with the club's under-23s since Jose Mourinho was appointed United boss in the summer.
Former Germany captain Schweinsteiger last played for the Red Devils in March, when Louis van Gaal was manager.
He said in August he had ""no personal problems"" with Mourinho, and United will be his last club in Europe.
""It's great to see him back,"" said United left-back Luke Shaw. ""We found out the news a couple of days ago.
""He's a big influence in the dressing room and obviously on the pitch, especially for the young players like myself.""
It is unclear whether Mourinho will now consider Schweinsteiger for first-team action.
He was named in United's Premier League squad for this season, but left out of their Europa League squad.
Schweinsteiger has made 31 appearances for the club since his £14.4m move from Bayern Munich in July 2015.
Simon Stone, BBC Sport
Before Schweinsteiger can think about a return he still hoped for during the dark days of being forced to train on his own, he needs to know why Mourinho brought him back into the fold.
After all, he cannot play against Fenerbahce on Thursday because he is not in Mourinho's Europa League squad.
With Ander Herrera banned, Schweinsteiger is an option for United's Premier League trip to Swansea.
However, given he is so short of match practice, is that really an option? Or is Mourinho merely reminding potential January suitors that the 32-year-old still exists?",World Cup winner Bastian Schweinsteiger has returned to training with Manchester United's first team.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Radovan Krejcir was arrested on Friday at his home in Johannesburg on a charge of kidnap and assault.
His lawyers filed a court application, saying he needed medical attention and risked kidney failure.
Krejcir has repeatedly denied having links to the criminal underworld.
The police have been accused of reacting slowly to reports of his alleged involvement in the killing of underworld bosses, reports the BBC's Pumza Fihlani from Johannesburg.
A number of his associates have been killed in separate incidents in recent months, local media report.
In July, Krejcir survived an attempt to kill him carried out by guns hidden behind a car number plate operated by remote control opened fire on him in Bedfordview, a suburb east of Johannesburg.
Krejcir reportedly described the shooting as ""something out of a James Bond film"".
He is challenging the government's attempts to extradite him to the Czech Republic, where he was convicted in absentia last year on tax fraud charges.
He moved to South Africa in 2007.
Our correspondent says South Africans have been keenly watching Krejcir's extraordinary career over recent months and the series of gangland shootings and killings with which he is allegedly linked.
They are worried that it might show that a well-connected, sophisticated and violent underworld still exists on the streets of Johannesburg, she says.
On Saturday, police chief Riah Phiyega said Krejcir's arrest was a major breakthrough.
""There are many investigations that are taking place, even on the charges that the suspects have been arrested for. We hope to arrest more suspects as the investigations unfold,"" she told reporters in the capital, Pretoria.
She did not reveal details of the charges against him.
The police watchdog, the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid), said it had launched an investigation into Krejcir's claim that he had he had been tortured.
Police are accused of taking him to an open field where he was ""allegedly shocked with a taser and a plastic bag was placed over his head to suffocate him"", Ipid said in a statement.
The High Court in Johannesburg ordered that Krejcir be transferred to hospital after his doctor testified that his injuries were consistent with those of someone who had been assaulted.
He could face renal failure if he was not taken to hospital, the doctor said.
In his ruling, Judge Ramarumo Monama said the doctor was a credible witness.

Pepe has made 334 appearances for Real, winning three La Liga titles and three Champions League trophies.
He missed Saturday's win over Juventus and added: ""I didn't say goodbye because they knew before I did.""
Pepe announced his departure in an interview with radio station COPE, and said he had not spoken to manager Zinedine Zidane since Madrid's Champions League final win in Cardiff.

"The unnamed woman had agreed Greater Manchester Police (GMP) could refer to her experience in a training session providing she remained anonymous.
However, she later learned her identity and medical history were disclosed to a wider audience.
GMP has apologised and said ""steps"" had been taken to stop similar occurrences.
The victim's solicitor said the payout was believed to be one of the biggest by a British force in a privacy case.
In a witness statement, the woman, who agreed to an out-of-court settlement, said she ""felt betrayed by GMP"".
The errors in this case by Greater Manchester Police almost beggar belief. Safeguarding victims is the most important priority in domestic violence police work.
Revealing a victim's identity, medical history and distressed 999 call, against their wishes, represents very grave mistakes. This episode is hardly likely to increase victims' confidence in the police.
The case also illustrates the use of part of the civil law that has principally been seen in cases involving celebrities whose privacy has been breached by newspapers.
'Misuse of private information' has been argued in a number of cases. It relies on a breach of Article 8 of the 1988 Human Rights Act; the right to respect for a private and family life.
The claimant has to establish they have a reasonable expectation of privacy in relation to the information concerned, and that privacy has been breached.
The media can argue the claimant's right to privacy is outweighed by the right to freedom of expression and that there is a public interest in publishing. The police have no such defence.
This case shows that Article 8 is not simply for celebrities and that public bodies, such as the police, can be sued if they breach it.
Nick McAleenan, from JMW Solicitors, described his client as a ""successful, professional woman"".
He said she ""suffered psychiatric harm"" after learning that her personal information was disclosed and that a tape of her 999 call following an assault was played at a training session.
He added that GMP had initially refused to accept it had done anything wrong and its internal investigation concluded that no officer had infringed the police code of conduct.
In May 2014, the force admitted breaching the woman's privacy but refused to acknowledge she had suffered distress or loss as a result which would entitle her to any damages.
Mr McAleenan said: ""This is information out there in the public domain. She can't put the genie back in the bottle and it's something that she is going to have to live with for the rest of her life"".
A GMP spokeswoman said it was ""an exceptional case"", adding: ""The force has taken action to protect the individual's information to prevent any issue in the future.""
She added: ""We have apologised to the woman involved... This was an unacceptable mistake; however, it was done with the best of intentions as part of training for partner agencies around recognising the signs of domestic abuse.""
A spokesperson from the domestic abuse charity, Women's Aid, said: ""Survivors of domestic abuse should be able to expect the highest standards from the police - and the police should be extremely careful when dealing with survivors.
""The survivor in question could have been put in a very dangerous situation; highly manipulative perpetrators of domestic abuse will stop at nothing to find out where their former partner is, or to gather information on them.""","A domestic abuse victim has received £75,000 from a police force after it revealed details of her treatment by a former boyfriend without her consent.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The Liverpudlian is second on 3,932 points, 40 behind leader and reigning champion Brianne Theisen-Eaton.
Johnson-Thompson has said her main aim this weekend is to get the 6,200 points needed for Rio.
She needs 2,268 points on Sunday in the three remaining events.
The 23-year-old began the day equalling her personal best of 13.37 seconds in the 100m hurdles and followed it up by clearing 1.92m in the high jump, a personal best outdoors.
After two events, Johnson-Thompson was in the overall lead but slipped to sixth following a disappointing 11.55m in the shot put - the worst mark in the field and 1.59m below the personal best she set earlier in the season.
She made amends for that poor display with a personal best 22.79 secs in the 200m, which pulled her closer to Canada's world silver medallist Theisen-Eaton.
Johnson-Thompson will start with the long jump on Sunday, the event which ruined her chances of gold at last year's World Championships following her failure to record a legal jump.
She said: ""I'm sure I'll be nervous again in the long jump. I really want to get a good jump in the first round.
""This is my first big competition especially after a knee operation last autumn so I just want 6,200 points and to be injury free and to be going home with my ticket for the Olympics.""
The Briton has also said her experience in Beijing changed her, created a ""new Kat"" who is determined to bounce back and quash her demons.
Her performances on the opening day in Austria promised much not only for this competition but the summer ahead.
Although she has repeatedly said Olympic qualification rather than regaining the title she won in 2014 is her priority this weekend, she looks set to vie with favourite Theisen-Eaton for first place.
And despite a poor display in the shot, her weakest event, Johnson-Thompson will take heart that she achieved her best heptathlon score of 6682 points in Gotzis two years ago, when her total after the opening day was also 3923.
The long jump, javelin and 800m remain on Sunday but fellow Brit Morgan Lake - adrift of her personal bests in all four events on the first day - is likely to fall short of the total needed for Rio.
Lake - recording 14.43 secs in the 100m hurdles, 1.86m in the high jump, 13.18m in the shot put and 26.12 secs in the 200m - is 29th overall.

"A ceremony, attended by PM Shinzo Abe, was held at Hiroshima's memorial park before thousands of lanterns are released on the city's Motoyasu river.
The bombing - and a second one on Nagasaki three days later - is credited with bringing to an end World War Two.
But it claimed the lives of at least 140,000 people in the city.
A US B-29 bomber called the Enola Gay dropped the uranium bomb, exploding some 600m (1,800ft) above the city, at around 08:10 on 6 August 1945.
On that day alone, at least 70,000 people are believed to have been killed. Many more died of horrific injuries caused by radiation poisoning in the days, weeks and months that followed.
People across Japan have observed a minute's silence to mark the anniversary. In Hiroshima a bell tolled at 08:15 local time - when the US aircraft dropped the bomb that flattened the city centre.
Addressing 40,000 people who attended the commemoration ceremony at Hiroshima's peace park near the epicentre of the 1945 attack, Mr Abe called for worldwide nuclear disarmament.
He said that that atomic bomb not only killed thousands of people in Hiroshima but also caused unspeakable suffering to survivors.
""Today Hiroshima has been revived,"" the prime minister said, ""and has become a city of culture and prosperity.
""Seventy years on I want to reemphasise the necessity of world peace.""
Mr Abe and Hiroshima Mayor Kazumi Matusi were joined by US Ambassador to Japan Caroline Kennedy for the official ceremony of remembrance on Thursday, which included silent prayers, the release of doves and a declaration of peace.
Mr Matsui described nuclear weapons as an ""absolute evil"" while urging the world to put an end to them forever.
""To coexist we must abolish the... ultimate inhumanity that is nuclear weapons. Now is the time to start taking action,"" he said in his annual speech.
Later in the day, thousands of paper lanterns will be released on the city's Motoyasu River - symbolising the journey to the afterlife of those who died.
The anniversary comes as divisions in Japan rise over Mr Abe's bid to pass unpopular legislation to expand the country's military role worldwide.

"Biffa says that its crews found 93 people sleeping in rubbish last year.
It says the cameras, fitted to 140 of its 800 trucks, would remind staff to check bins before emptying them.
Last year four people sheltering in bins died when they were tipped into the back of trucks.
Biffa's Tim Standring told BBC Radio 4's You and Yours the cameras would give drivers extra ""peace of mind"" and that some vehicles would also record footage from inside hoppers.
The company was not spying on its staff, he said, saying the move was designed to protect them from the ""anguish"" of not realising a person had been inside the bin.
Mr Standring, the firm's divisional health, safety, environment and quality coach, said: ""If it's the only place you've got to stay and it's the most secure place I can kind of see the appeal, but the down side of it is if we don't find you, you're not going to survive.""
He added: ""Once you're in the hopper, the blade comes down and it crushes and breaks the waste and it will take it back into the body [of the vehicle] where it's compacted again.
""These machines won't differentiate between cardboard, wood and unfortunately people as well.""
Biffa hopes that all of its refuse lorries will have the new technology by the end of the year.
The company formed a partnership with the Chartered Institute of Waste Management and homelessness service StreetLink to raise awareness of the issue of people sleeping in bins.

"The Gobbins coastal path in Islandmagee was the brainchild of Irish railway engineer Berkley Deane Wise.
It first opened in 1902 and quickly became famous as a white knuckle walk.
Edwardian era visitors were able to have a close encounter with waves and wildlife.
The path, which is carved into black basalt cliffs, was an engineering triumph - it's connected by a network of walkways and bridges - the most iconic of which was the tubular bridge.
Post-war austerity spelt decline for the 1.5 mile walkway and it was closed to the public in the 1950s.
Since then only seabirds have enjoyed the stunning views from this part of our coastline.
Rumblings down the years about restoring the path finally turned into action in 2013, when the restoration project got under way.
Since then, £7.5m has been spent replacing bridges, hand rails and constructing a new visitors centre.
The tubular bridge has been replaced with an almost identical replica.
While modern engineering methods have made the work safer, construction worker Paul Montgomery says he has an enhanced respect for those who built the original path.
""They did an immense job, because the beams I have seen from the old bridges were concrete cased and to get them down here would have been a feat in itself as there were no cranes in those days,"" he said.
""So I have a lot of respect for them.""
While health and safety is more of a concern nowadays some things have not changed, including the steep walk down to the starting point - a hole through rock known as Wise's eye.
Before starting the Gobbins experience, visitors are given a safety briefing and a hard hat in the visitors centre, it's then on to a minibus for the two-mile journey to the path.
The walk is described as strenuous and is not suitable for everyone.
No-one under the height of 1.2m will be permitted, a good level of fitness is required and people with cardiac, respiratory, asthmatic or joint conditions are urged not to attempt it.
The route allows visitors to see coastal birds such as puffins, guillemots and kittiwakes up close. It's also possible to spot porpoises off the coast.
This attraction has created some much needed employment in the area and one of the tour guides is Robert Stewart, a local farmer who has decided to try something new.
""I'm very enthusiastic about my new job,"" he said.
""Everybody knows about the Giant's Causeway but I think we have something here that can compete with the Giant's Causeway and is just as beautiful.""
Groups of 10 to 15 will be guided along the bridges which cling to the cliff face just metres above the sea.
Tours should be booked in advance and the costs are £8.50 for adults, concessions £6 and a family rate of £23.
There will also be a cliff top walk which will be free for the public and has a viewing platform that hangs over the cliff.  This element of the work is not expected to be complete until September.
The project is over a year late and £1.5m over budget, but Mid and East Antrim Council has big hopes for the attraction and is expecting 50,000 visitors a year.
Tourism Minister Jonathan Bell, who walked the path on Tuesday, said it was ""staggeringly beautiful"".
""It is something that you could bring visitors from anywhere in the world to and be very proud of the quality of the tourism offering,"" he said.
""Having done it, I think it represents real value for money and puts Northern Ireland with another - and I genuinely mean this -  top quality, international tourist destination.""
The council's mayor Billy Ashe said it was fantastic for the area.
""I think that first and foremost it will put us back on the map,"" he said.
""Berkley Deane Wise thought that this path could be one of the world's attractions - I agree with him.

"Mr Miliband called the prime minister's refusal to take part unless the Green Party was involved a ""pathetic excuse"".
He said he would debate with ""anyone invited by the broadcasters"".
But Mr Cameron said the Labour leader was ""chickening"" out of facing the Greens and all ""national parties"" must be represented.
The exchanges came after Mr Miliband, Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg and UKIP leader Nigel Farage urged broadcasters to press ahead with televised debates before the 7 May poll even if Mr Cameron refuses to take part.
The three leaders have written to Mr Cameron saying it would be ""unacceptable"" for the prime minister to refuse to appear, saying an empty podium should be provided in his absence.
In response, the BBC, Sky News, ITV and Channel 4 said they ""remain committed"" to staging debates before the poll on 7 May.
Raising the issue in Parliament, Mr Miliband said Mr Cameron had argued back in 2010 that it would be ""feeble"" for any party leader to walk away from the debates but was now threatening to do just that.

""It is not for him, it is not for me, it is not for any party leader to decide who is in the debate,"" he said. ""It is up to the broadcasters, that is the country we live in.
""I think he does protest too much. He has run out of excuses, he is running scared of these debates and in the words of his heroine Margaret Thatcher 'he is frit'"".
Mr Cameron said Mr Miliband wanted ""to debate having a debate"" because he did not want to talk about the economy and other issues.
He said he was keen to defend his record during the campaign, suggesting he would support the idea of two debates, one a head-to-head encounter between him and Mr Miliband and another in which all ""national parties"" were represented.
""The more time he and I can spend on television and in the television studio, the happier I will be,"" he said.
But Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, who was sitting next to the prime minister, was heard shouting ""excuses, excuses"" as Mr Cameron answered one of Mr Miliband's questions.
In identical letters to Mr Cameron, Mr Miliband, Mr Clegg and Mr Farage called for a repeat of the 2010 debates - the first ever leaders' TV debates in a British election - and insisted they ""not the property of the politicians"".
They wrote: ""I believe it would be a major setback to our democratic processes if these debates were not repeated in 2015 because of one politician's unwillingness to participate.""
The added: ""Therefore, if you are unwilling to reconsider, the three party leaders who have committed to participate will ask the broadcasters to press ahead with the debates and provide an empty podium should you have a last-minute change of heart.""
Under plans put forward by the BBC, Sky News, ITV and Channel 4 in October, the pre-election live TV debates would include the Conservatives, Labour, Liberal Democrats and UKIP.
Mr Cameron would take on Labour leader Mr Miliband head-to-head in one debate, another would feature Mr Cameron, Mr Miliband and Lib Dem leader Mr Clegg, and a third would also include UKIP's Mr Farage.
The suggested schedule is for debates on 2 April, 16 April and 30 April, ahead of the general election on 7 May.
Mr Farage said the BBC would be ""within its rights"", under the terms of its editorial guidelines, to stage a debate without Mr Cameron and providing an empty podium would be ""entirely appropriate"".
""If David Cameron chooses not to turn up that is his hard luck,"" he told the BBC News Channel. ""My guess is that if the broadcasters hold firm, Mr Cameron will buckle and say yes.""
Lord Ashdown, who is leading the Lib Dems' general election campaign, urged broadcasters to ""stick to their guns"" or else he feared the impetus for the debates would ""ebb away"".
He told Sky News: ""You just can't let the prime minister or anybody else basically hold the country and our democracy to ransom by saying no.""
But Green Party leader Natalie Bennett said she backed Mr Cameron's stance and said it was in the interest of the three other leaders to help persuade broadcasters that her party should be included in one of the debates.
Ms Bennett said ITV had not yet made a final decision and she hoped to hold talks with the broadcaster in the near future.
""Staging the debates without the prime minister might score a point but would not serve the public, who rightly expect the political parties and the broadcasters to find a format that is acceptable to all concerned,"" she wrote in a letter to the trio.
""If you indicated that you were open to the inclusion of the Greens, then I feel sure that ITV would respond.""
John Curtice, professor of politics at the University of Strathclyde, said that having ""nailed his colours to the mast"" over the Green Party's participation, it would be difficult for Mr Cameron to shun the debates if they were invited.
The three debates in 2010 were watched by a total of 22 million people, and they have been cited as one reason for the increase in turnout at the election, which rose for the first time since 1992.
While the debates were a ""good test of political leadership"", Prof Curtice told the BBC that they had dominated the campaign and ""not necessarily succeeded in reaching out to more marginal voters"".
The SNP and Plaid Cymru, which have more seats in Parliament than either UKIP or the Green Party, also say they should be represented in any series of debates.
SNP deputy leader Stuart Hosie said: ""The idea that the SNP, bigger than UKIP and the Lib Dems combined in terms of membership, should be excluded from debates which are broadcast into people's homes in Scotland is just simply quite unacceptable.""
In a statement, the four broadcasters said: ""The debates played an important role in informing millions of our viewers in 2010 and we will continue to work with all the parties to ensure that they happen again in 2015"".

"Prof Higgs, who does not own a mobile phone, said a former neighbour had pulled up in her car as he was returning from lunch in Edinburgh.
He added: ""She congratulated me on the news and I said 'oh, what news?'""
The woman had been alerted by her daughter in London that Prof Higgs had won the award, he revealed.
He added: ""I heard more about it obviously when I got home and started reading the messages.""
The 84-year-old emeritus professor at the University of Edinburgh was recognised by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences for his work on the theory of the particle which shares his name, the Higgs boson.
He shares this year's physics prize with Francois Englert of Belgium, and joins the ranks of past Nobel winners including Marie Curie and Albert Einstein.
The existence of the so-called ""God particle"", said to give matter its substance, or mass, was proved almost 50 years later by a team from the European nuclear research facility (Cern) and its Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in Geneva, Switzerland.
Speaking for the first time about the award at a media conference at the University of Edinburgh, he said: ""How do I feel? Well, obviously I'm delighted and rather relieved in a sense that it's all over. It has been a long time coming.""
An old friend told him he had been nominated as far back as 1980, he said.
Prof Higgs added: ""In terms of later events, it seemed to me for many years that the experimental verification might not come in my lifetime.
""But since the start up of the LHC it has been pretty clear that they would get there, and despite some mishaps they did get there"".
Stressing the involvement of other theorists and Cern, he added: ""I think clearly they should, but it is going to be even more difficult for the Nobel Committee to allocate the credit when it comes to an organisation like Cern.
""I should remind you that although only two of us have shared this prize, Francois Englert of Brussels and myself, that the work in 1964 involved three groups of people, (including) two in Brussels.
""Unfortunately Robert Brout died a few years ago so is no longer able to be awarded the prize, but he would certainly have been one of the winners if he had still been alive.
""But there were three others who also contributed and it is already difficult to allocate the credit amongst the theorists.
""Although a lot of people seem to think I did all this single-handed, it was actually part of a theoretical programme which had been started in 1960.""
Prof Higgs was born in Newcastle, but developed his theory while working at the University of Edinburgh.
The landmark research that defined what was to become known as the Higgs boson was published in 1964.
Discovering the particle became one of the most sought-after goals in science, and the team of scientists behind the $10bn LHC at Cern made proving its existence a key priority.
In July of last year, physicists at Cern confirmed the discovery of a particle consistent with the Higgs boson.
Prof Higgs, who had often been uncomfortable with the attention his theory brought, was in Geneva to hear the news, and wiped a tear from his eye as the announcement was made.
Reacting to the discovery at the time, he told reporters: ""It's very nice to be right sometimes.""",Nobel Prize-winning scientist Prof Peter Higgs has revealed he did not know he had won the award until a woman congratulated him in the street.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The 31-year-old Australian was hurt during the Chiefs' narrow Champions Cup loss at Ulster and needs surgery.
Salvi joined the Chiefs in the summer of 2015 from Leicester and became a key part of the side that made last season's Premiership final.
""We're still waiting to learn the full extent of it but it looks relatively serious,"" head coach Rob Baxter said.
Salvi was twice short-listed for the Premiership's Player of the Year award while at Leicester and is a former Australia Under-21 captain.
""He does put in a huge contribution over 80 minutes, and that's probably what we'll miss the most,"" Baxter told BBC Sport.
""His biggest quality is his consistency. He turns up every week, and even when we've had some poor performances and even when some individuals within the side have played poorly, Julian's contribution has always been absolutely first rate,"" added Baxter.
""He's virtually always our top tackler, virtually always our top clearout guy, and probably the thing that people don't appreciate about him is how important he is to our attack.
""A lot of people talk about open-sides as being tacklers and defenders and disruptive people, but Julian is very important to our attack because he clears so many breakdowns.""",Exeter flanker Julian Salvi has been ruled out for the rest of 2016 after injuring his biceps.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"The papers were presented to a meeting of health board chief executives and civil servants last month.
They suggest the NHS is facing a £400m funding gap, and sweeping changes will be needed for boards to break even.
The Scottish government said it was committed to ""protecting and increasing the NHS budget"".
The papers were passed to the BBC and The Herald by a senior NHS whistleblower, who said they had become frustrated by the argument of the ""Yes"" campaign that the biggest threat to the NHS comes from the UK government.
The documents state: ""The status quo and preservation of existing models of care are no longer an option given the pressing challenges we face.""
The whistleblower has alleged that pressures on the NHS come from Scottish government policies.
The confidential documents relate to a meeting held by NHS bosses on 6 August 2014.
As part of an initiative to transform care by 2020, legislation has been passed by the Scottish government to encourage more community care.
However, the papers say this has been undermined by ""continued commitments"" which are ""directly in conflict"" with the 2020 vision and increase the cost of expensive hospital care.
The documents say new obligations are ""not fully funded"".  The documents conclude that the ""status quo in terms of service and workforce planning is not an option"".
The papers outline a funding gap of £400-£450m in the next two financial years, 2015-17, which is described as ""a level significantly in excess of that previously required"".
The documents suggest that health boards will have to consider centralising hospitals and closing services - a measure which the SNP vowed to stop when it was elected in 2007.
The Scottish government reversed the closure of Accident and Emergency departments at Monklands and Ayr hospitals, but the papers suggest such dramatic measures may be back on the table.
""Radical and urgent decisions need to be made regarding the shape and configuration of services,"" the document states.
But it also points out that boards are ""without the mandate and authority to implement the scale of change and redesign required"".
""We need to commit to these priorities and accept that significant changes require to be implemented,"" the papers conclude.
The whistleblower told the BBC: ""Services are unsustainable right across Scotland from three emergency centres in Lanarkshire, to emergency care at the Vale (of Leven) to paediatrics at St John's (in Livingston), and with particular issues for more rural boards, hence the problems at Grampian.
""The current pattern of services is underpinned but short-term money and fixes won't stack up going into next year.
""There is a complete gap between policy announcements about care in the community and more money for primary care, and the announcements and commitments which continually increase the cost of acute care.""
The Scottish government said the paper was ""part of the regular discussions among NHS leaders to plan for NHS Scotland's future"".
Health Secretary Alex Neil said: ""We've protected Scotland's NHS from the Tories' cuts, and with independence we can ensure that it is never again under threat from Westminster's dangerous obsession with austerity.
""Despite Scotland's budget being slashed by 7.2% by George Osborne between 2010/11 and 2015/16, our increases in health spending means that the NHS is receiving record high funding, with a budget increase of over £1bn between 2010/11 and 2015/16.""
He added: ""To ensure we can continue to develop the NHS, it's important that NHS boards regularly discuss their future plans to inform budget discussions with Scottish government officials, and to identify how we will continue to deliver quality care and treatment.
""We continue to develop our health service to meet the changing demands of the people of Scotland, and that's why we've already legislated to integrate health and social care from April next year.
""This integration of services is particularly important to ensure our elderly population is kept well and provided with care in the best setting for their wellbeing.""",Confidential papers passed to the BBC suggest a radical cost-saving plan will be implemented in the Scottish NHS after the referendum.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Lt Gen Zaid al-Saleh, head of the government's local security committee, said rebel fighters did not ""have much time"" and needed to ""surrender or die"".
Tens of thousands of civilians are also believed to be in the rebel enclave.
Syrian state TV showed footage of people in Aleppo celebrating, amid reports the army was close to victory.
The director of the UK-based monitoring group, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, warned of ""real massacres"" being carried out in Aleppo.
Rami Abdel Rahman called on the international community to find a safe haven for civilians.
Rebels have now lost more than 90% of the territory they once held in eastern Aleppo since government forces stepped up their offensive to regain full control of the city a month ago.
Russia, which backs the government, says more than 100,000 civilians have been displaced by the fighting and that 2,200 rebel fighters have surrendered.
Aleppo was once Syria's largest city, and its commercial and industrial hub before the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad began in 2011.
For much of the past four years it has been divided roughly in two, with the government controlling the western half and rebels the east.
Troops finally broke the deadlock with the help of Iranian-backed militias and Russian air strikes, reinstating a siege on the east in early September and launching an all-out assault weeks later.
On Monday morning, the official Sana news agency cited a military source as saying that the army had taken full control of the key southern district of Sheikh Saeed, as well as the neighbouring areas of Karam al-Daadaa and Saliheen.
Hours later, nearby Bustan al-Qasr, Kallasa, Fardous, Jaloun and Jisr al-Haj had also fallen after rebel fighters withdrew in the face of an intense government bombardment, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported.
Late on Monday the monitoring group said that clashes were continuing in Salah al-Din neighbourhood and other areas remaining under rebel control.
In an interview with the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme, an English teacher who is still inside a rebel-held area described the conditions as terrible.
""The situation inside the eastern part of Aleppo is literally doomsday,"" Abdul Kafi Alhamado said. ""Bombs are everywhere, people are running, people are injured in the streets, no-one can dare go to help them, some people are under the rubble.""
The Syrian Observatory says that at least 415 civilians and 364 rebel fighters have been killed in rebel-held areas since 15 November. Another 130 civilians have died in rebel rocket and mortar attacks on the government-controlled west.
Russia and the United States, which backs the rebels, held talks in Geneva over the weekend to discuss a deal for civilians and rebel fighters to leave Aleppo.
But on Monday, US officials said their Russian counterparts had rejected a proposal for an immediate cessation of hostilities to allow for safe departures.
Analysts say the fall of Aleppo would be a big blow to the opposition, as it would leave the government in control of Syria's four largest cities.
However, the head of the umbrella group that represented political and armed opposition factions at failed peace talks at the start of this year insisted that their determination to overthrow the president would not be diminished.
""If Assad and his allies think that a military advance in certain quarters of Aleppo will signify that we will make concessions, then [I say] that will not happen,"" Riyad Hijab, general co-ordinator of the High Negotiations Committee, told reporters.
As fighting intensified for the last rebel-held neighbourhoods, there have been frantic efforts to secure guarantees to evacuate the most vulnerable - the very ill, gravely injured and innocent children. All efforts have been in vain.
""It's a far dream,"" one frustrated aid official told me on Monday, about a long-standing request for a UN-organised medical mission for about 500 patients and their families.
Two efforts, which seemed close to agreement, collapsed last week when Russia asserted there was no need for a ceasefire since tens of thousands were escaping without one.  Sources say Russia then shifted its stance. But rebel groups demanded a ceasefire and a delivery of aid first.
In desperation, aid agencies reduced their request from 72 hours to just three. A group known as ""Doctors Under Fire"" has also been pleading for the evacuation of hundreds of children.
British surgeon Dr David Nott says ""we only need a temporary cessation of 60 minutes to save them all.""

"The federation represents thousands of rank and file PSNI officers.
Its chairman, Mark Lindsay, has said confidence in the office of the ombudsman is at an all-time low.
A spokesperson for the ombudsman said the comments were ""disappointing"" and ""at odds with the feedback from police officers who had been investigated"".
Mr Lindsay told the federation's annual conference that ""reform is not so much desirable as essential"".
He also said the PSNI is in a state of crisis because of reducing budgets and officer numbers.
Criticism of the office of the ombudsman by the federation is not new.
In his speech on Wednesday, Mr Lindsay said the federation accepted the need for the independent investigation of complaints against police officers.
But, with Ombudsman Dr Michael Maguire among the audience at the La Mon House Hotel, he suggested some feel they are victims of a ""witch hunt"".
""It gives me no pleasure to say that, unfortunately, there is very little officer confidence in relation to the operation of the ombudsman's office,"" he said.
""The credibility of the office is also seriously questioned.""
The federation chairman highlighted the ongoing PSNI investigation into the theft and unlawful disclosure of documents from the ombudsman's office.
He also cited the discovery of a gun and ammunition in a filing cabinet belonging to a member of staff in the office last year.
""There is an obvious need for an independent avenue of appeal, whereby officers will have meaningful redress against malicious and inept investigations,"" he said.
""The ombudsman is with us today and I say to him that this isn't about you, but rather the legislative architecture of the system you preside over.
""If your office conducts itself with the high standards you demand of police officers, then surely you have nothing to fear from such accountability.""
Mr Lindsay said the level of assaults against police officers by members of the public is ""unacceptably high"" and called for tougher action to protect them.
He told the conference that eight out of 10 PSNI officers who responded to a survey said they had been victims of a physical or verbal assault during the past year.

"Rocky Taylor, a friend of 40 years standing, said the former BBC radio DJ and Crackerjack presenter had died in hospital in Bournemouth.
Stewart's former brother-in-law, Adriano Henney, tweeted to say ""Fun guy-Huge loss"".
Director of BBC Music Bob Shennan said Stewart had been a ""stalwart"" of popular music broadcasting.
Mr Shennan said Stewart's shows had been enjoyed by millions of listeners.
Ed 'Stewpot' Stewart: Your memories
Stewart's BBC Radio 2 colleagues were extremely saddened, he said, adding: ""We are thinking of Ed's friends and family at this difficult time.""
Stewart's fellow DJ from his early days on pirate radio, Tony Blackburn, who also went on to Radio 1, said Stewart would be missed.
""A lovely guy, loved his golf and he loved playing the songs on Junior Choice.
""I think he'll probably be best remembered for Junior Choice because he did that programme, I think, particularly well.
""He was very, very good at that, and of course, on television.""
His former colleague and friend of 50 years, BBC DJ David Hamilton, said Stewart ""was a little bit like a good wine; he just got better as time went on"".
The DJ, also known by the nickname ""Diddy"", said he spoke to his old friend just a few days ago.
He said: ""We used to play football together in the showbiz football team, we even once rode in a speedway race together at Wembley Stadium, so we've done a lot of things together.
""He was a really good guy, Ed, and I really will miss him.""
His younger sister, Sue Mainwaring, 69, described him as hardworking, loyal and ""such a good brother"".
""We had such fun. When he was on the pirates [radio stations] he had two weeks on and one week off - of which every weekend he'd invite everybody back for jazz sessions. Celebs used to come along, including Kenny Everett, David Hamilton, Tony Brandon. He loved jazz. He loved music.""
She said she had spent Christmas and New Year with him and other members of the family.
Devon-born Stewart's broadcasting career spanned more than 50 years. He started out as an announcer, film critic and rugby reporter with Radio Hong Kong.
In an interview with the Express newspaper in 2014, he said he had returned to England five years later and joined pirate radio ship Radio London, based four miles off shore.
He was one of the first presenters on Radio 1 when it launched in 1967, and went on to become a regular Top of the Pops presenter in the 1970s.
He was a regular Radio 2 presenter for 15 years, and during that time broadcast from the summits of Ben Nevis and Snowdon, Mount Vesuvius volcano in Italy, and also live from the Falkland Islands.
On television, Stewart was best known for children's favourite Crackerjack. He hosted the show from 1973 to 1979.
He was also a longstanding presenter of children's show Junior Choice, which last broadcast on BBC Radio 2 over Christmas.
On it he coined his trademark catchphrase: '''Ello darling.""
In his sign-off at the end of his final programme, he thanked listeners, saying: ""I'll be with you whenever, but have a great Christmas Day, won't you, folks?""
Off air, he was a keen golfer and dedicated Everton FC fan.
On Twitter, TV presenter Noel Edmonds left heartfelt messages about the man he called his ""mentor"".
Edmonds joined BBC Radio 1 in 1969, taking over from the sacked Kenny Everett in 1970. At 21, he was the station's youngest DJ at the time.
""In '67 Ed Stewart heard a DJ audition tape, liked it, passed it to Kenny Everett and my career was born. Stewpot I owe you everything xN,"" he tweeted.
Former Radio 1 DJ and current Radio 2 broadcaster Simon Mayo wrote in a tweet: ""How sad to hear of the passing of Ed Stewart.  Junior Choice was always a radio classic"".

"The phrase ""rapid rise through the ranks"" is a standard line in profiles of political leaders. But it's rarely as speedy as in Natalie Bennett's case.
The Australian-born former Guardian journalist woke up on New Year's Day 2006 and decided she wanted to do something to change the world.
After pondering her options (should she get involved with an NGO or the UN?) she joined the Green Party. Within six short years she had become its leader.
Three years after that she was sharing a stage with the prime minister and other party leaders in a televised general election debate.
Her sudden arrival on the frontline of British politics was all the more remarkable because she had never won an election, other than the one that had made her party leader.
Her first aim when she took on the job was to insert the Green Party - routinely ignored or patronised by the mainstream media - into the national conversation.
But when media outlets finally began calling, on the back of a surge in support for the party, she sometimes found it difficult to get her message across in a suitably snappy way.
Her vision for the party was to show how ""economic and environmental justice are indivisible"", she explains, ""the idea that tackling environmental problems isn't an add-on luxury"".
It was ""not a easy concept to get across"", she confesses. ""I still don't think I've got the 12 second soundbite. But I am going to keep working on it.""
""It's a classic Shakespearean thing,"" she says of her struggles with the broadcast media. ""It's both my strength and my weakness that I answer the question.""
But, she adds, ""when you get asked a stupid question, it's rather hard to know what to do at that point. And I guess I get tangled up in my desire to answer a question, even when it's a really stupid question"".
Did she get asked a lot of stupid questions?
""Yes.""
Asked for an example, she ponders for a minute, before highlighting an interview with the BBC's very own John Humphrys, which led to her having ""to spend time, valuable peak time, explaining how the interviewer got the question wrong. And listeners don't particularly like that because it's all technical and boring and you are arguing with the interviewer but if it's entirely on the wrong track you have to"".
She says she has some sympathy with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who has also attracted criticism for broadcast interviews in which he has deviated from the usual prepared soundbites.
""The focus on the individual is a problem for British politics and it's very uncomfortable when the focus is on you,"" she says, arguing that the media in continental Europe are focused more on policies than personalities and trivia.
""I am not complaining - you have to work within those limits,"" she adds, but she believes British politics is ""broken"" and the media must take its share of the blame.
""There should be some pressure on the journalist to ask better, more sensible questions,"" she argues.
There was nothing particularly stupid about the question that prompted her darkest moment in a radio studio, however, when she struggled over several excruciating minutes, punctuated by coughing fits, to answer a question from LBC's Nick Ferrari on her party's housing policy.
She was quick to hold her hands up afterwards, apologising to supporters and blaming her sub-par performance, in the heat of the general election campaign, on ""brain freeze"".
""That was a very tough moment. And of course you take a bit of a punch to the stomach.
""But then a few weeks later I was up on the leader debates, able to look David Cameron in the eye and challenge him about his failure to welcome Syrian refugees to Britain, and that was one of the best moments.
""My great problem on that day was that I was in no way well enough to actually be doing anything. I'd had about three and a half hours sleep and I'd been throwing up most of the night. I should have just pulled the day but that's partly a function of how we got to that point.
""We weren't used to getting a lot of media attention and it was very, very hard to turn media attention down.""
One of Ms Bennett's proudest moments came at the end of the BBC leaders debate when she joined Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood and Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon in a ""group hug"", while Labour leader Ed Miliband looked on awkwardly.
This felt like a watershed moment for women in politics, she says, sending out the message ""that politics can not just be 'dog eat dog', it can be people agreeing on some things and disagreeing on others but supporting each other"".
As a lifelong feminist, she is particularly pleased to have been told by ""lots of young women"" that they had been inspired by the ""group hug"", which she stresses had not been planned in advance.
""I hope and think that that moment really, in 15 years' time, 20 years' time, we might see a whole crop of MPs down the road who will reference that moment as the time they decided they were going to try and get there.""
Ms Bennett's decision to pitch for the anti-austerity vote, positioning the Greens as a left-wing alternative to what was then Ed Miliband's Labour Party, struck a chord with idealistic young people who felt alienated by mainstream politics, and led to a surge in party membership.
But then Jeremy Corbyn came along and shifted Labour firmly to the left, inspiring idealistic activists to join his party in numbers the Greens could only dream about.
Hasn't the Green Party, which had a mixed set of results in May's elections, losing four councillors in England and failing to make progress in Wales but getting its best ever result in London, been crowded out of the picture by Labour?
Ms Bennett insists this is not the case, arguing that there is a ""very clear distinction"" between the Greens and Labour on a range of issues - from nuclear weapons to fracking - and that voters know exactly what they are getting when they vote Green.
But she is also open to the idea of a ""progressive alliance"" at the next general election, with local Green Parties potentially making electoral pacts with Labour, Plaid Cymru, the SNP or other parties who broadly share their outlook.
She remains a passionate advocate of electoral reform. The Green Party fielded a record number of general election candidates in 2015, standing in 93% of constituencies, and gaining more than a million votes. By rights, she argues, the party should have 25 MPs. She believes the case for scrapping what she sees as Britain's outdated first-past-the-post electoral system is gaining ground in the country.
She says she has had an ""amazing"" four years as leader, and has no regrets, believing the party is in better shape now, having quadrupled its membership and gained a foothold in the national debate on issues such as welfare and the economy, than when she took over.
But she is also keen to stress that she will not be leaving politics.
""I'm aiming to turn former leader into a role in its own right, to keep travelling the country, supporting local parties, doing media. Leadership is a role we can share around. It's not you become leader, that's the pinnacle, and then you disappear.""
Asked if she has any advice for the next leader, she says trust the party membership.
Anything else?

"Ashford Borough Council is owed more than £70,000 and Canterbury City Council is owed almost £45,000 in unpaid fines, BBC South East has found.
More than half of Kent's councils are using a private company to help recover fines issued to foreign drivers.
In Brighton more than three-quarters of fines were unpaid, a Freedom of Information request has found.
Brighton and Hove City Council told BBC South East it had issued 5,402 fines to foreign drivers, with 1,216 paid, and 3,400 remaining unpaid.  The council said it had written off the remaining 746 fines.
Most of those drivers fined in Kent were in tourist destinations in East Kent and near the Channel ports.
A private company called Euro Parking Collection has been hired by eight councils in Kent to work with Vehicle Licensing Authorities to collect some of the outstanding fines.
Illegal parking in the UK is a civil offence so councils cannot request drivers' names and addresses from their home countries.
In France and some other European countries however, illegal parking is a criminal offence dealt with by the police.
Patrick Troy from the British Parking Association said: ""Local authorities don't have the means by which to enforce fines against foreign registered vehicles in the same way the do against UK registered vehicles.
""There is discrimination here and we've been arguing for some time that the government should work with colleagues in the European Union to negotiate reciprocal arrangements.""",Foreign drivers owe south-east councils tens of thousands of pounds in unpaid parking fines issued in 2014-15.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Chris Coleman's team are likely to face a tough draw as they will be one of the lowest-seeded teams.
But former striker Rush believes the biggest nations will not want to face a Welsh side which lost only once in qualifying.
""They won't want Wales in their group,"" Rush told BBC Wales' Sport Wales.
""I'm not saying we are going to win it but the opposition won't like to play Wales.
""Every game will be a big test and they will learn from it and I think we will win a game.""
Rush is the country's all-time leading goalscorer with 28 goals, while Gareth Bale took his tally to 19 with Wales' second goal in the 2-0 win over Andorra.
Real Madrid forward Bale scored seven of Wales' 11 goals in Euro 2016 qualifying, with Aaron Ramsey netting twice and Hal Robson-Kanu and David Cotterill scoring one apiece.
But former Liverpool and Juventus striker Rush is not too concerned by Wales' limited forward options.
""The lads that play there I think you forget the work that they do. They put in a tremendous work rate,"" Rush added.
""What we may be missing is someone to tap the ball in
""But Robson-Kanu, [Sam] Vokes and [Simon] Church give it 110% so you can't knock that. I think sometimes you need that goal to give you confidence.

"The union wants to take over Newport Gwent Dragons and the ground, hoping to solve the water-logging problems by laying a 4G surface.
But  if County stay up Football League rules do not allow artificial surfaces.
""Ideally we would have wanted to put an artificial pitch down,"" said WRU chief executive, Martyn Phillips.
""We want the ground to be a hub for rugby for women and girls and kids and get it played on all day, every day.
""That is probably not going to be possible now because Newport County need a grass pitch.
""So we are in a dialogue with them now about how, over the summer, we put it back to what a pro club should have.""
County, under boss Mike Flynn, are looking to pull of what would be  a miraculous relegation escape against Notts County, having been 11 points from safety as recently as March.
Following financial difficulties at the Dragons, the WRU has offered a deal to take over the region and a vote is set to be held by shareholders of Newport RFC who own Rodney Parade.
The rugby club, Dragons and County share the pitch which has major drainage problems that have forced postponements and abandonments this season.
County have an agreement to play at Rodney Parade until 2023 and Phillips said it would be honoured.
However, relegation would raise the prospect of a 4G pitch being laid as such surfaces are allowed in  the National League
Phillips added: ""Newport County have a licence there and, despite what anyone might think, we are not in the business of wanting Newport not to be a pro club.
""We are like everyone else in that we hope they get the win and carry on.
""But the flipside of that is that the pitch is no good for us and no good for them.""",The Welsh Rugby Union will halt plans for an artificial pitch at Rodney Parade if Newport County stay in the Football League.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"The Mi-8 transporter was brought down by rebels, Russia says, in northern Idlib province.
It was returning from delivering humanitarian aid to the besieged city of Aleppo, the defence ministry said.
It is not clear which group brought the helicopter down.
An alliance of forces, including hardline jihadist factions, is the dominant power in Idlib.
Jabhat Fateh al-Sham - formerly known as Jabhat al-Nusra - is among those active in the province, and so-called Islamic State has vowed to carry out jihad against Russian forces.
The helicopter was carrying three crew and two officers.
Pictures on social media, purportedly of the latest Russian helicopter downing, showed burning wreckage and bodies, with armed men milling around.
Footage showed at least one body being dragged away. Another is seen apparently being trampled on.
This is the worst single loss of life for Russia since it launched its air offensive in Syria in support of President Assad towards the end of last year.
Moscow says the helicopter was not involved in a military mission, but was delivering humanitarian aid.  Rebel sources appear to confirm this.  It may not have been known to those who shot the helicopter down, as most of Russia's airpower in Syria has been used for military purposes to support pro-government forces.
But it will further inflame feelings in Russia against rebels in Syria.  Moscow has repeatedly said it sees little distinction between the rebels in terms of brutality and extremism.  The graphic images of victims posted online of the aftermath of the incident will add fuel to the fire.
Russia has previously, though seldom, lost aircraft since it launched operations in support of the Syrian government at the end of September 2015.
In July, two Russian pilots were killed when their helicopter was shot down east of the city of Palmyra by so-called Islamic State (IS).
Last November, the pilot of a Russian Su-24 fighter plane was killed when the aircraft was shot down by Turkey on its border with Syria.
A Russian marine sent on a mission to rescue the pilot was also killed when his helicopter was shot down.
Russia is a key backer of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and is supporting pro-government forces with air strikes on rebels.
Government forces cut off rebel-held eastern parts of Aleppo last month.
Russia and Syria announced the opening of what they called humanitarian corridors for civilians and rebels wanting to surrender, but few people are reported to have used them, fearing they would be targeted.

Opposition activists have dismissed as a lie Russian claims that 160 civilians had left rebel-held districts.
The United Nations has warned that basic supplies for the around a quarter of a million people who live in besieged areas will last only three weeks.
On Sunday, rebel groups south of Aleppo launched a push to try to break the siege, in what observers said was one of the biggest counter-offensives in months.",A Russian military helicopter has been shot down in Syria killing all five on board - the deadliest single incident for Russia's military since its air campaign began last September.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The clip, said to have been filmed in the city of Mosul, in northern Iraq, is the first footage of John Cantlie to emerge in more than a year.
In the footage, Mr Cantlie ridicules US attempts to destroy IS.
The Foreign Office said it was ""looking at the contents of this latest propaganda video"".
Mr Cantlie was last seen in a similar video in Syria in February 2015.
Like the latest film, it also had him addressing the camera as if he was presenting a television report.
Mr Cantlie, who is originally from Hampshire, has seen his work appear in the Sunday Times, the Sun and the Sunday Telegraph.
He has been held captive in Syria twice. After being kidnapped in July 2012, he escaped with help from the Free Syrian Army.
He was then kidnapped for a second time when he returned to the country towards the end of 2012. It is believed he was with US journalist James Foley, who was later killed.
Last month, Mr Cantlie's supporters set up a petition on Parliament's website urging the government to ensure his safe release.",A video has appeared online apparently showing a British photojournalist who was taken hostage in Syria by so-called Islamic State in 2012.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The Australian Livestock Exporters' Council said the footage, released by animal rights group Animals Australia, was ""horrific"".
Animals Australia said it had been filmed inside the two abattoirs approved to process Australian cattle.
Exports to Egypt were halted in 2006 for four years over similar concerns.
And in 2011, livestock exports to Indonesia were suspended after evidence of cruelty emerged there.
The Egyptian videos have not been made public, but Animals Australia said they showed cattle believed to have come from Australia being treated in a ""vicious, cruel and clumsy"" way.
The group is campaigning for a full ban on livestock exports.
""The way that these animals are treated are quite horrific,"" said spokeswoman Glenys Oogjes.
In one instance, a cow fell off the processing line and was chased through the abattoir before having its legs cut and being stabbed to death, she said.
""It is quite terrible and it shows systemic problems in these abattoirs for our animals. And how Australia ever sent animals back there after a suspension in 2006 is beyond us.""
The chief executive of the Livestock Exporters' Council, Alison Penfold, said the acts shown in the footage were ""exceptionally distressing"" and ""completely unacceptable to the industry and to Australians"".
She told the BBC the trade was undertaken under a memorandum of understanding between the Australian and the Egyptian governments.
The industry was investigating, she said, and working with the Egyptian authorities to ensure the welfare of animals already at the facilities.
Australia's Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry said in a statement it was ""pleased with the level of co-operation"" from the Egyptian authorities.
Australia exports more than 700,000 cattle each year, and the industry is worth about A$1bn ($1.03bn: Â£0.7bn) a year.
But pressure is growing for a total ban on live exports amid a series of cruelty scandals.
Agriculture Minister Joe Ludwig said he backed the industry's voluntary suspension.
He said the export industry had ""bright future"" but that it had to ""maintain animal welfare outcomes"", The Australian newspaper reports.",Australia is suspending the export of live cattle to Egypt after video emerged showing extreme cruelty to animals in Egyptian abattoirs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite the Super League leaders looking set to be overturned by second-placed Warrington, Radford's side came from behind to grab a late 12-10 win.
""That's the togetherness we have in this team,"" he told BBC Sport.
""We have the ingredients there to go on from this. We have the foundations in place to go and achieve more.""
Hull, who have already qualified for the Super League play-off semi-finals, still have to host both Warrington and third-placed Wigan, as well as visiting fourth-placed St Helens before determining who might line up at Old Trafford for the Grand Final on 8 October.
Radford added: ""There's the League Leaders' Shield to still play for and then we could be only 80 minutes away from a Grand Final.""
The same two goals are also still very much in the sights of Tony Smith's Warrington.
""It will go down as one of the better finals for many a year,"" said the Wire boss, after his club suffered their first defeat at the rebuilt Wembley and missed out on a fourth Challenge Cup victory in eight seasons.
""We'll go away and lick our wounds, but we won't sulk for too long. We're a proud club and we've still got a great opportunity to win two other trophies.""
Even in a sport that is full of ups and downs in so many contests, it is an impressive statistic that Saturday's final was the 14th time that Hull have come from behind to win this season.
""It's history-making for us and we should feel rightly proud,"" said Radford. ""There's been a lot of past Hull teams with some tremendous players who have not achieved what we have.
""And it was great for Jamie Shaul to get the winning try. He's a local lad like me, so he gets a lot of stick when we lose. But he can now go and walk his dog with pride.""
Modest Hull scrum-half Marc Sneyd played down his own contribution to Hull FC's late rally after being named man of the match.
""I was surprised I'd won,"" he said, suggesting that he was expecting hooker Danny Houghton to pick up the Lance Todd Trophy.
His coach Radford also had praise for Houghton, who made a try-saving tackle on Ben Currie with two minute remaining, adding: ""He would not look out of place in the England team.""

"In-form striker James Vaughan gave the hosts a 22nd-minute lead before Reece Brown scored a 45th-minute free-kick from around 40 yards.
Bury were stunned by three goals in eight minutes through Erhun Oztumer and a Jason McCarthy brace, but Tom Soares pounced at the death to deny Walsall a third straight win.
Tom Pope and Amadou Bakayoko had gone close at each end before Pope crossed for Vaughan to slide in his 17th goal of the season - and seventh in three games.
Neil Etheridge then saved a Pope header and blocked the striker's follow-up, while Bury's Rob Lainton saved a Bakayoko shot.
But Bury doubled their lead as Brown's free-kick caught Etheridge off his line and flew into the top corner.
The Shakers eased off in the second half, though, and Walsall made them pay. Matt Preston had a shot blocked on the line and Lainton denied Isaiah Osbourne from the rebound.
But Oztumer hit a 20-yard free-kick into the bottom corner on 71 minutes to spark the Saddlers' fightback.
Five minutes later, McCarthy fired home from Bakayoko's cut-back before the Southampton loanee headed home from Osbourne's cross.

"Some 60 excavators and 100 dump trucks are being used in the search. The boy fell down the 40m dry well in Baoding, Hebei province on Sunday morning.
He had been helping harvest vegetables, his father told Chinese media. The child's condition is unknown.
Oxygen, food and water have been supplied. The 30cm-diameter well is too narrow for an adult to retrieve him.
After two days of careful digging, rescuers have dug only 13m down the metal shaft, which threatens to collapse at any moment.
An 800-square metre work area has been cleared to facilitate rescue attempts, a volunteer told The Paper, a Shanghai-based news website.
The well had been left unused for five years and there were no warning signs. Visual imagery has so far failed to locate the boy.
Many locals volunteered to help in the rescue, rushing to the scene after learning about the accident on WeChat, a popular communication app in China.
Most netizens sent good wishes to the boy.
""It was saddening to read about such news. As a mother, it was heartbreaking to see a child fall into a well. I hope the child will be alive and alive,"" one user called 80 Hou Bu Huai wrote.
Some wondered who was to blame.
Weibo user S_AND_YY wrote: ""Parents have to take care of their children and it's dangerous everywhere.""
But not everyone agreed.
""The kid is in primary one already. Do his parents have to spend every minute with him? Is it possible? Shouldn't the well be the focus? If the well didn't exist, would this accident happen?"" wrote another user.

"A rugged, mountainous country, with lush valleys to the south and north, it is Central Asia's poorest nation.
Tajiks are the country's largest ethnic group, with Uzbeks making up a quarter of the population, over half of which is employed in agriculture and just one-fifth in industry. A third of Tajikistan's population is under 14 years of age.
The Tajik language is very close to Persian, spoken in Iran, and to Dari, spoken in Afghanistan.

The five-year civil war between the Moscow-backed government and the Islamist-led opposition, in which up to 50,000 people were killed and over one-tenth of the population fled the country, ended in 1997 with a United Nations-brokered peace agreement.
Tajikistan's economy has never really recovered from the civil war, and poverty is widespread. Almost half of GDP is earned by migrants working abroad, especially in Russia, but the recession in 2009 threatened that income. The country is also dependent on oil and gas imports.
Economic hardship is seen as a contributing to a renewed interest in Islam - including more radical forms - among young Tajiks.
Tajikistan has been accused by its neighbours of tolerating the presence of training camps for Islamist rebels on its territory, an accusation which it has strongly denied.
Tajikistan has relied heavily on Russian assistance to counter continuing security problems and cope with the dire economic situation. Skirmishes with drug smugglers crossing illegally from Afghanistan occur regularly, as Tajikistan is the first stop on the drugs route from there to Russia and the West.
Russia maintains military garrisons in Tajikistan and in 2004 took back control over a former Soviet space monitoring centre. These developments were widely seen as a sign of Russia's wish to counter increased US influence in Central Asia.
Economic ties with neighbouring China are extensive. China has extended credits and has helped to build roads, tunnels and power infrastructure. Chinese firms are investing in oil and gas exploration and in gold mining.","A former Soviet republic, Tajikistan plunged into civil war almost as soon as it became independent from the Soviet Union in 1991.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"She was 12 at the time and living with her parents and two siblings in northern Peru.
On that night, two officials came to their home and took away her father.
Mr Katsura, who owned a small general store, was arrested because he was part of Peru's prosperous Japanese community.
""My father told them he hadn't done anything wrong, but they didn't listen to him,"" she recalls.
Japanese people began migrating to Peru in considerable numbers at the end of the 19th Century, drawn by opportunities to work in the mines and on sugar plantations.
By the 1940s, an estimated 25,000 people of Japanese descent lived in Peru. Many had become lawyers and doctors, or owned small businesses.
Their prosperity, further fuelled by racism, soon triggered anti-Japanese sentiment in Peru, Stephanie Moore explains.
Ms Moore, a scholar at the Japanese Peruvian Oral History Project, says after the outbreak of World War Two, the Japanese community in Peru became a target, and their assets were confiscated.
""In May 1940, as many as 600 houses, schools and businesses belonging to citizens of Japanese descent were burned down,"" she says.
Following Japan's 1941 attack on the US naval base at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii, the US government asked a dozen Latin American countries, among them Peru, to arrest its Japanese residents.
Records from the time suggest the US authorities wanted to take them to the US and use them as bargaining chips for its nationals captured by Japanese forces in Asia.
Mr Katsura was among the 2,200 Latin Americans of Japanese descent who were forcibly deported to internment camps in the US.
Blanca Katsura, who is now 83 and lives in Northern California, remembers how she learned of his fate.
""A month after my father was detained, he sent me a letter because it was my birthday,"" she recalls.
""He had been taken to Panama from where they were planning to send him to the US,"" she adds.
Six months later, Blanca Katsura's mother decided to take her three small children to the US to search for her husband.
""When we arrived in New Orleans after a month-long trip, they confiscated our passports and then sent us by train to the Crystal City camp.""
As many as 4,000 people were interned during World War Two in this camp in Texas run by the US Immigration and Naturalization Service.
Most of the detainees were of Japanese descent, although some German and Italian immigrants were also held there.
It was at Crystal City that Blanca Katsura was reunited with her father. ""I was shocked, he had lost so much weight,"" she remembers.
For the next four years, her family lived in the barracks at the camp.
Her memories of that time are not particularly traumatic, she says.
""Being a child at the time time, I had no worries and made lots of friends.
""We were able to go to school and learn Japanese,"" she adds.
Ms Katsura says she later learned that the camp authorities were keen for the children to learn Japanese so they would be able to speak the language once they were deported to Japan.
Chieko Kamisato's memories of life at Crystal City are less positive.
""You could call it a concentration camp, because we were surrounded by barbed wire fences and guards with guns,"" she says.
""We couldn't go out at all, although we were free to move around inside,"" she recalls.
""My parents were really bitter about the situation because they were forced to come to the US. They had no choice,"" she says.
Ms Kamisato's father had moved to Peru from Japan in 1915 and had worked hard to open a bakery in the capital, Lima.
Now 81, she lives in Los Angeles.
Of the 2,200 Latin Americans of Japanese descent to be interned in the US, 800 were sent to Japan as part of prisoner exchanges.
After World War Two ended, another 1,000 were deported to Japan after their Latin American home countries refused to take them back.
Ms Katsura's and Ms Kamisato's families successfully fought deportation and were eventually allowed to remain in the US.
In 1988, then-President Ronald Reagan signed the Civil Liberties Act and apologised on behalf of the US government for the internment of Japanese-Americans.
Under the act, the government paid tens of thousands of survivors of the camps $20,000 (Â£13,000) each in reparation.
But Japanese-Latin Americans did not qualify for the payments because they had not been US citizens or permanent residents of the US at the time of their internment.
Outraged, they filed a class-action suit and 10 years later, the US government agreed to pay them $5,000 each.
Most accepted, but a small group headed by camp survivor Art Shibayama decided to hold out, demanding to be paid the same as Japanese-Americans.
Blanca Katsura says that even though her childhood at the camp may not have been traumatic, no amount of money can compensate her family for its loss.
""My parents wanted to go back to Peru but couldn't. They missed the life they had there,"" she recalls.
""The Peruvian government sold us out to the US government and that is not a very nice feeling. How would you feel about it?""",Blanca Katsura will never forget the night of 6 January 1943.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"John Griffith-Jones was asked at a Treasury Select Committee hearing whether the Treasury had leant on the FCA or undermined its independence.
He said that the ""simple answer"" was ""no to both"".
Acting chief executive Tracey McDermott said the suggestion was ""nonsense"".
Two senior FCA figures were speaking at a committee hearing called after it emerged that the inquiry, described as a ""thematic review"", had been scrapped.
The FCA had planned to look at whether pay, promotion or other incentives had contributed to scandals involving banks in the UK and abroad.
Ms McDermott told the committee the review had been shelved because ""we didn't think that we would be able to put out something that was sufficiently useful or valuable to make it worthwhile spending resources and time on doing it"".
She said the review would have duplicated other work carried out elsewhere, notably by the Banking Standards Board, which was ""looking at precisely the same issue"".
She said the FCA was now seeking to ""build on work done by other bodies"" and would be focusing on individual firms through regulatory supervision.
Banks around the world have faced huge fines from regulators for their involvement in numerous scandals.
In May last year, the news agency Reuters calculated that 20 global banks had paid Â£152bn in fines and compensation to customers since the 2008 financial crisis.","The chairman of the City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), has said political considerations played no part in its decision to shelve an inquiry into the culture of banking.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Their rise to third place in the polls comes despite a string of pre-election scandals.
One local candidate stood down after a picture emerged of her wearing a swastika armband.
Another was highlighted for posting racist and anti-immigrant comments online.
And yet, the revelations appear to have had little obvious effect on voters, even if the mainstream parties do not want anything to do with the party.
They are led by the dapper and clean-cut Jimmie Akesson, 35.
Voters also seemed unperturbed by the news that he has gambled half a million kronor (Â£43,000; 54,000 euros; $70,000) online.
""Every crisis the party gets into Mr Akesson handles very efficiently,"" says Ulf Bjereld, professor of political science at the University of Gothenburg, who sees him as a very skilful politician, if uncharismatic.
Any political party would struggle to fend off accusations of racism, he told the BBC, but the party leader simply took them off the list and said they were not welcome.
They will now occupy 49 seats in Sweden's 349-seat parliament.
By publicly stressing the Sweden Democrats' zero tolerance towards racism for the past two years, he has been careful not to fall out of step with the tolerance that Swedes believe they have towards ethnic minorities.
In contrast with other EU countries, Sweden is granting automatic residence to all refugees fleeing the Syrian conflict and some 80,000 people are expected to apply for asylum this year.
The Sweden Democrats have carefully refined their 2010 election platform, when their campaign commercial featured an elderly woman pushing slowly towards a welfare desk.
""You can choose if you want to save money from the pensions or immigration budgets,"" ran the commentary, over menacing music.
The pensioner is overtaken by a group of women in burqas.
The party made it into parliament in 2010 with 5.7% of the vote, five years after Jimmie Akesson took on the leadership.
Beforehand the party had been linked for years to neo-Nazis and other extremist groups.
In a speech in August, he identified himself as a nationalist but called for his party to show they were ""broad and inclusive"".
But he was forthright on the risks of political Islam.
""Islamism is the Nazism and communism of our time. It has to be met with disgust and much stronger resistance than has so far been the case.""
The anti-immigration rhetoric has been toned down and carefully argued, with a policy of preferring to help refugees in their own countries.
There are obvious parallels with France's National Front which, under the leadership of Marine Le Pen, has moved into the political mainstream.
The two parties go back many years, and Ms Le Pen visited Jimmie Akesson last year in Stockholm. A few months ago he praised the National Front's ""modern, quite fresh direction"".
That does not mean the Sweden Democrats have shaken off their past but, with two MEPs in the European Parliament, they are now part of the same grouping as the Eurosceptic UK Independence Party - the Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy group.
Swedish voters are attracted to the party, more because it gives a voice to people who dislike the political elite than its stance on immigration, Prof Bjereld believes.
And although he argues that party membership will always have a racist element, the main stance is more xenophobic than racist.
""One of Jimmie Akesson's skills is that he sends one message to the racists in his party and another to the general public.""","They see themselves as the kingmakers of Swedish politics and, after polling 13% in national elections, the far-right Sweden Democrats are now difficult for mainstream parties to ignore.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Hills Quarry Products has submitted a planning application to the county council for a sand and gravel quarry near the village of Clifton Hampden.
It said the development, known as Fullamoor Quarry, will see 2.5m tonnes of earth extracted over 10 years.
But residents said the plan poses a threat ""to the health and wellbeing"" of their communities.
Chairman of campaign group Bachport (Burcot and Clifton Hampden Protection of the River Thames) Ian Mason said: ""It's vital that people express their deep concerns.
""A quarry would devastate a tranquil part of the Oxford Green Belt bordering the Thames and we fear more flooding as the proposed site is in the flood plain.""
He added that the biggest concern was the traffic a quarry would generate, with 570 lorry movements a week.
Hills Quarry Products director Peter Andrew said the application followed an 18-month public consultation, which included meetings with residents.
He said: ""As a result of the feedback received, we significantly reduced our plans in relation to the volumes of material we hope to extract and the time we will take to work the site.
""The final restoration plans were also scaled back so that no additional material is brought on to site, which in turn reduced the overall number of vehicle movements.""

"The Coseley School in Dudley has 557 pupils - just over half its 975 capacity - and last year's GCSE results placed it bottom in the borough.

The consultation will run until 5 April, with a decision due in May.

If the plan goes ahead, years seven, eight and nine will go to different schools next year.

"The four-piece group and their manager, who were aged between 19 and 32, died in the early hours of 13 February following a gig in Stockholm.
Their car crashed into a raised section of a bridge and plummeted into a canal.
The inquest heard no alcohol or drugs was found in the blood of manager Craig Tarry, 32, who was driving.
Post-mortem examinations also showed the four band members had not taken drugs and had only consumed small amounts of alcohol.
The band's agent Graham Bennett told the inquest at Warrington Coroner's Court that the up-and-coming group were in Sweden for a festival showcasing young artists.
Viola Beach had already played at the Reading and Leeds festivals last year and the Stockholm event was their first gig outside the UK.
After the performance, they were travelling in a black Nissan Qashqai near the SÃ¶dertÃ¤lje Canal, about 18 miles from the capital, when a bridge was raised to let a boat pass underneath.
The inquest heard that the car was slightly over the speed limit as it was travelling at 108km/h (67mph) in a 100km/h zone.
Flashing lights signalled that the bridge was about to be raised with the middle section of the road lifted horizontally, the inquest heard.
Mr Tarry drove down a verge past stationary queuing traffic and through the first set of barriers, about 120m from the bridge, the court heard.
The car then travelled in a ""controlled manner"" at between 70 and 90km/h down the centre of the road.
It continued through a second set of barriers - 30m from the drop into the canal - and hit the raised section of the bridge before plummeting 25m, hitting the water within 15 seconds.
The court heard a tanker using the canal, which had requested the bridge to be lifted, then passed over the crash spot and ""contact"" with the car could not be ruled out.
The crew of a passing boat saw the car fall but initially thought it was ice.
Technical examinations did not find any errors with the car, barrier system or the procedure for raising the bridge.
One warning light on the bridge was out of order but there were at least 10 warning lights and flashing signals, the inquest heard.
Although the road was wet, it was not frozen with ice.
Post-mortem examinations found that all died from head injuries apart from Mr Lowe whose cause of death was given as drowning.
The court heard that the three band members sitting in the back of the car were not wearing seatbelts but those in the front were, and had to be cut from the vehicle.
Cheshire Coroner Nicholas Rheinberg said ""none of the young men will have suffered"" as they died.
The Swedish authorities have recommended improvements to the crossing, including LED signs and cameras on the bridge.
In the wake of their deaths, the band's first single Swings & Waterslides reached number 11, while their song Boys That Sing was performed by Coldplay in a tribute at Glastonbury.
Posthumously, Viola Beach scored a number one album in August.

"The new rates will be implemented in October and will benefit a million workers.
Business Secretary Vince Cable said he had accepted a recommendation from the Low Pay Commission that the minimum wage should increase by 3%.
It is the first time in six years that the rise will be higher than inflation.
The rate for 18 to 20-year-olds will go up by 10p to £5.13 an hour, a 2% increase.
The rate for those aged 16 and 17 will rise by 7p to £3.79, also a 2% rise.
Apprentices will earn an extra 5p an hour, taking their wages to at least £2.73.
The consumer prices index (CPI) rate of inflation is currently 1.9%.
""The recommendations I have accepted today mean that low-paid workers will enjoy the biggest cash increase in their take-home pay since 2008,"" said Mr Cable.
He also suggested that all companies should consider helping their staff to share in the fruits of an improving economy.
""I urge businesses to consider how all their staff - not just those on the minimum wage - can enjoy the benefits of recovery,"" he said.
Meanwhile, the man who set up the minimum wage 15 years ago, said it is in need of major reform.
Professor Sir George Bain, founding chair of the Low Pay Commission, said the benchmark was a ""child of its times"" when launched in 1999.
But speaking to BBC Newsnight on Wednesday, he said it had become a ""blunt instrument"" and that many employers could now afford to pay their workers much more.
""If you set it at the 'living wage', which is about £7.65 an hour, you would cause massive unemployment in areas like retail and social care,"" Sir George added.
""But there's only about five sectors where this is true. There's a whole range of sectors where you could easily afford to pay more than the minimum wage.""
Sir George, who has chaired a review of the minimum wage for think-tank the Resolution Foundation, also said there should be a ""special case for London to have a higher national minimum"".
His report also recommends that the Low Pay Commission give longer-term forecasts for the benchmark, to help employers plan for the future.
The latest rise means the national minimum wage is still well below the definition of low pay, as set by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).
This equates to two-thirds of the median full-time hourly wage - about £7.71 an hour. About five million UK workers currently earn below that level.
The latest figure is also well below the living wage, which is £8.80 per hour in London, and £7.65 in the rest of the country.
""Across the country, people are struggling to make ends meet,"" said Dave Prentice, the head of the Unison trade union.
""The sooner we move to a living wage, the better,"" he said.
In January this year, Chancellor George Osborne said he backed the idea of the national minimum wage reaching £7 an hour by October 2015.
The latest announcement could pave the way for that to happen, but it would need a rise of more than 7% next year to do so.
Unite, the country's biggest trade union, said the rise announced was ""timid"".
""To make matters even worse, George Osborne cruelly held out hope that the rate would rise to £7,"" said Len McCluskey, Unite's general secretary.
""The government claims it is on the side of working people but companies are sitting on a cash mountain of £500bn and they should be forced to share more of it with the lowest paid,"" he added.","The national minimum wage will increase by 19p an hour to £6.50, the government has announced.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Wendy Wright, 51, from Newcastle-under-Lyme, thought the vote for UKIP may have been higher had it not been for its disastrous campaign.
""I'm not surprised Labour won because of the way UKIP handled the campaign,"" she said.
""The people of Stoke seemed to think he [Paul Nuttall] didn't come from the area and they didn't believe his pack of lies.
""It's a relief UKIP didn't get in but [Labour retaining the seat] just means things are going to stay the same.""
Ms Wright said there had not been a high turnout because ""people aren't interested in politics"".
She said: ""They've kind of lost faith and lost hope. They think, what's the point, nothing's going to change.
""It's a deprived area and it's a shame because the people are so welcoming and friendly.""
Veronica Millington, 71, from Blythe Bridge, said she and husband Anthony, 75, were ""Labour through and through"".
They backed Mr Snell in the by-election and also voted to stay in the European Union.
""I think the people of Stoke do care about politics and they want to make things better,"" she said.
""I think they were misled by UKIP in the beginning. They seemed to promise them so much and people saw it as a new chance really.
""It was only when all the lies came out they saw how many wrong things had been said.""
Mr Millington, 75, expressed concern about why so few people bothered to go to the polls.
""The turnout seemed to be very low and I think a lot of people think it was a foregone conclusion.
""They thought the Labour Party would win. Now whether or not they've had a jolt from the outsider now, I don't know.""
For a city that has had such a strong relationship with the Labour party, the changing political landscape over the past seven decades reveals a lot about the strength of feeling in the community.
Labour has won all 18 elections since since the inception of the Stoke Central constituency, with the Conservatives coming second until 2001.
But although Labour enjoyed a heyday in the 1960s and 70s, their share of the vote has consistently fallen over the years down to a record low of 37% in this by-election.
So why did this city of proud, working class voters fall out of love with Labour?
""Things started to change because of a growing alienation of the people of Stoke-on-Trent from Westminster,"" says Prof Mick Temple from Staffordshire University.
""Industry was decimated in the 1980s - coal, steel and the Potteries.
""When I first came here [in the early 90s] infrastructure was poor, schools were poor and still today, unemployment is higher than the national average.""
From the closure of Shelton Steel Works - where 10,000 once worked - to the shrinking of its famous pottery industry, the people of Stoke-on-Trent have lived through some turbulent times.
But the bleak images of derelict factories and houses often shown by the media are not a true reflection of the passion and pride of a community that is fiercely proud of its heritage.
Data shows 6.2% of adults in Stoke Central claim unemployment benefit, far higher than the national average of 3.8%.
In recent years employers such as Bet365, Michelin Tyres and Goodwin have invested millions of pounds into their businesses, providing jobs for thousands of people.
Hanley's famous pottery industry is also enjoying something of a resurgence, with Emma Bridgewater investing more than Â£1m in its thriving ceramics factory.
Middleport Pottery, home of world-famous Burleigh, is in the national spotlight thanks to the success of BBC Two's The Great Pottery Throw Down.
Millions of pounds are being spent regenerating the city.
For many people though, the investment has been too little, too late.
""The feeling is that the city has been passed by Westminster and the EU, and that is why people voted Leave so overwhelmingly,"" says Prof Temple.
""There are many towns in the north of England where people feel the same - areas that are ripe for UKIP.""
From 2005, the BNP and UKIP began to resonate with voters, coming fourth and fifth in that year's election and again in 2010.
By 2015, UKIP had won so much support its candidate Mick Harold came second to Tristram Hunt for a seat that had the lowest voter turnout in the whole of the UK.
Pub owner Tony Flackett, 69, backed Paul Nuttall in Thursday's poll.
""It feels sad, it's such a shame, they've worked really hard and people have come from all over the country.
""I've always voted for Conservatives but the last two years I voted UKIP because of Brexit and immigration.
""But life goes on and at least they reduced the margin.""
Tom Wilson, 26, voted for UKIP in the by-election and said he was ""very upset"" at the result.
""I think Labour winning is very bad news for Stoke-on-Trent.
""There has been years of neglect in Stoke with money spent only on Hanley.
""I think only UKIP would have made a change for the people of Stoke.""
UKIP has made moves to appeal to former Labour voters, as well as those who formerly backed the Tories.
""They're more pro-State, pro-NHS. They recognise that strong nationalistic message supported by the working class,"" says Prof Temple.
Between the 2001 and 2011 Censuses, the non-white population doubled and there was a relatively high population of Muslims, he said.
""I'm not saying the response was a racist one - Stoke-on-Trent was getting less and less money from the government and the EU and the feeling was the traditional working class community was being overtaken.
""Many working class voters felt they could not express their views within the Labour party.
""The BNP and UKIP gave them a chance to say how they felt.""
Now Mr Snell is the town's new MP, the challenge is on for him to win back the trust of former Labour supporters and engage with new ones.
Lee Woolrich, 33, from Stoke-on-Trent, is head of client services for a digital agency but did not vote in the by-election.
""I'm ashamed really that I didn't use my vote, but I almost don't think I invest enough in politics to make an informed decision,"" he said.
""I don't think young people are engaged in politics. I think they are more so recently because of what's happened in America.
""I read about Paul Nuttall and some of his views and policies and I don't believe it's what we need here.""
Mr Woolrich believes politicians need to take more of an interest in Stoke-on-Trent - he too feels the place has been forgotten and is badly represented by the media.
""Stoke is doing great without those kinds of ideas.
""I love the developments in Hanley and the cultural quarter.
""Stoke is showing signs of change and getting in line with cities like Manchester.
""On a local level, I like the direction things are going in but I don't necessarily think government in London will listen to the people of Stoke.
""I hate that stigma that Stoke isn't a nice place to live.
""It doesn't do the place justice. It's a beautiful city steeped in history.""
And Prof Temple agrees. ""It's a much more attractive place,"" he said.
""I've been here for 24 years, I've lived all around the world and this is the friendliest, most coherent community I've ever known.
""Stoke-on-Trent has an identity most places in the UK have lost.
""There's a very strong sense of community. It's a place where friendship and family is still strong.""","In the wake of his victory, Stoke Central's new Labour MP Gareth Snell claimed it had been a triumph for the ""politics of hope"".",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Under-20s coach Murty has been in charge for three Premiership matches following Mark Warburton's departure.
And his side responded to defeats at Dundee and Inverness CT by beating St Johnstone 3-2 at Ibrox for his first Premiership win in charge.
""He's been brilliant,"" said midfielder Hyndman, who scored the late winner again Saints on Wednesday night.
""It's always a tough position as a kind of interim manager, especially with the way things have gone,"" on-loan Bournemouth midfielder Hyndman added.
""But I credit him for coming in and establishing what he wants us to do. I think the boys got behind him quite well.
""The results didn't really show what he was doing and how good he was but it was nice to give him that positive feeling on Wednesday night.""
Rangers are expected to appoint a new head coach next week, after Saturday's Scottish Cup quarter-final at home to Hamilton Academical.
And with the Premiership gap between third-placed Rangers and second-placed Aberdeen now cut to six points, USA international Hyndman says there is still plenty to play for this term.
""Of course there is,"" he said. ""We saw the Aberdeen result the other night (1-0 defeat at Hamilton) but we're just focused on ourselves at the same time.
""We need to get ourselves right and I think we took our first step against Saints. It was about the three points, it wasn't about how we got it.
""After recent results we've had it was very important we got three points on the board and thankfully we did that.""
Fellow loan player Jon Toral, who joined Rangers from Arsenal in January, was also keen to praise Murty.
""It was massive for Graeme on Wednesday,"" said the Spaniard. ""He has put a lot of effort into the other games as well, he has really helped us and for us to give him that first league win was crucial.
""At the minute we are just thinking about the cup tie on Saturday and then whatever happens happens. If a new manager has until the end of the season to work with the players and then to kick on next season it would be great for the club.""",Emerson Hyndman believes interim Rangers boss Graeme Murty deserves huge credit for the job he has done.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A report by technology news site Gizmodo said staff responsible for what was shown to Facebook's 1.6bn users frequently chose to bury articles they did not agree with.
Responding to the allegations, the network's head of search Tom Stocky wrote that the site ""found no evidence that the anonymous allegations are true"".
The claims come weeks after Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg publicly denounced the policies of likely US presidential nominee, Donald Trump.
""I hear fearful voices calling for building walls and distancing people they label as 'others.',"" the 31-year-old said at his firm's recent developers conference.
However, Facebook insisted Mr Zuckerberg's view did not influence what stories are given added visibility on the network.
The Trending Topics column appears in the top right corner of a typical Facebook page. It is designed to highlight what subjects are being discussed heavily by Facebook users around the world.
Facebook explained in a statement that this list was edited by humans so as to avoid regularly recurring popular topics - such as ""lunch"".
Facebook's Mr Stocky explained: ""Popular topics are first surfaced by an algorithm, then audited by review team members to confirm that the topics are in fact trending news in the real world and not, for example, similar-sounding topics or misnomers.""
The Gizmodo story, which quoted a person it said they had been one of the editors, alleged Facebook staff were routinely tampering with Trending Topic stories.
Gizmodo's source added that staff were told to seek out stories published on the BBC, CNN and other mainstream sites ahead of publications with a clearly stated political bias - even if the stories originated on those smaller outlets.
Also, if several mainstream media sites were covering the same story, Facebook would - according to the source - artificially place it in the Trending Topic column, even if it was not being discussed heavily by users.
Breitbart, one of the leading conservative news sources in the US, said the reports confirmed what they had ""long suspected"", that ""Facebook's trending news artificially mutes conservatives and amplifies progressives"".
The anonymous source also claimed that stories staff favoured - such as the Black Lives Matter movement - were given artificially greater prominence. Facebook said that this was ""untrue"".
After a day of growing reports across social media and in conservative-leaning publications, Facebook's Mr Stocky posted a response on his profile.
""We have in place strict guidelines for our trending topic reviewers as they audit topics surfaced algorithmically,"" he wrote.
""Reviewers are required to accept topics that reflect real world events, and are instructed to disregard junk or duplicate topics, hoaxes, or subjects with insufficient sources.
""Facebook does not allow or advise our reviewers to systematically discriminate against sources of any ideological origin and we've designed our tools to make that technically not feasible.
""At the same time, our reviewers' actions are logged and reviewed, and violating our guidelines is a fireable offense.""

"Strathspey Steam Railway plans to recreate part of a free celebratory train journey held in 1863 between Aviemore and Grantown-on-Spey.
Grantown cannot be reached by train today, but on 3 August's anniversary a steam locomotive will pull a train from Aviemore as far as Broomhill.
Passengers wearing Victorian clothing will travel free.
The steam railway group runs locomotives along 10 miles (16km) of line between Aviemore and Broomhill.
It hopes to eventually add three more miles of track (4.8km) to reconnect Aviemore with Grantown-on-Spey.
The platform at Aviemore will be decorated for next weekend's anniversary celebrations.

"Speaking during a live link-up with a primary school in London, he also said he was ""immensely proud"" to be wearing the Union Flag.
Major Peake added that he was now into the final phase of training, in which he was focusing on the essentials.
He said astronaut training had been rigorous and involved retaining immense quantities of information.
Tim Peake is the first Briton to be selected as an astronaut for the European Space Agency, through a route backed by the UK government.
He was in Houston, Texas, when he spoke live to schoolchildren at Queen's Park Primary School in West London. The event was organised as part of a UK Space Agency programme called Esero, which is designed to use space to help enhance science education.
""I'm immensely proud to be British and to be serving in the European Space Agency,"" he told BBC News.
""It's always very apparent to me, wherever I'm travelling, whether it be Houston, here, or Russia, that you're wearing the flag and you're representing your country.""
Major Peake, who was a British Army helicopter pilot before his selection for the astronaut corps, is set to fly to the International Space Station in December on a Russian Soyuz rocket.
He will be accompanied on the launch from Baikonur Cosmodrome by the American astronaut Timothy Kopra and the Russian Yuri Malenchenko.
The Briton said the training was now ""ramping up"" as the 15 December launch date approached.
""The training is a long process and we've covered such a huge variety of subjects. One of the main challenges is actually being able to retain all of that information over a two-and-a-half-year period,"" he said.
""I'm in the final six months before launch and we're just focusing on the essentials of the Soyuz spacecraft, emergency training... and scientific payloads that are going to be on the space station.""
Pupils who listened to Major Peake talk, and got the opportunity to ask him questions, seemed to be impressed by the experience.
Abdullah Hashim, who is 10, said he was ""an extraordinary man"" and an ""inspiration"". Salma Sarumi, 8, said it was ""amazing"" to have the live link-up at her school.
Fellow students Cherise Panzu, Mario Albu and Susu El-Abbas also seemed to have been inspired by the event. Cherise called it a ""once in a lifetime opportunity"".
Major Peake believes the flight will bring significant benefits to the country and British industry.
""This is a step forward in that it's the UK government supporting human spaceflight,"" he explained.
""What that means is that UK industry, UK education and the UK scientific community can now embrace human spaceflight. That means taking part in scientific research that's being conducted not only on the International Space Station, but within the other European Space Agency human spaceflight programmes.""","The UK's first official astronaut, Tim Peake, says he is ""well prepared"" as his December launch date approaches.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It means BP will have to make the payments that stem from the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig.
BP argued that the deal meant it could fall prey to inflated or bogus compensation claims.
BP agreed to the compensation deal in 2012, but argues it has been misinterpreted.
Shares in BP fell 1.7% in London on Monday.
BP asked the Supreme Court to consider whether people and businesses seeking payments under the settlement included individuals who had not actually suffered any injury as a result of the oil spill.
The Supreme Court's rejection of this appeal by BP is the latest in a series of setbacks for the oil firm.
BP is trying to limit payments over the environmental disaster, which claimed the lives of 11 people and became the largest US offshore oil spill in history.
The settlement agreement has no cap, but BP initially estimated that it would pay roughly $7.8bn (Â£6.1bn) to compensate victims.
It now says it can no longer give a reliable estimate for how much the deal will cost.
BP has already paid out $2.3bn in so-called business economic loss claims out of a total of $4.25bn in compensation claims to individuals and businesses, according to Patrick Juneau, the administrator appointed by the courts to handle claims.
The settlement process is also separate from other court proceedings relating to the spill, including environmental and criminal penalties.
BP has set aside $43bn to resolve all claims.
In September, a US judge ruled BP was ""grossly negligent"" in the lead-up to the 2010 oil spill.

"HS2 Ltd is overseeing the expansion of Euston to cater for passengers using the first phase of the new rail line between London and the Midlands.
The revamp was originally scheduled to end in 2026 but the firm now says it will finish in 2033.
Camden Council has warned the extended works will ""blight"" the area, but HS2 says it will be ""easier to manage"".
The station is set to gain six new platforms and an additional concourse, with building works due to start in 2017.
In a change to plans submitted two years ago, HS2 Ltd has proposed the construction of five further platforms within the existing station should be delayed.
They would be ready for phase two of HS2 which will run from the capital to Leeds and Manchester in 2033.
Rupert Walker, Euston development director of HS2 Ltd, said: ""It is more construction over a longer period but it's less intense. It will be easier for us to manage.""
The impact of building all 11 platforms in one go would have caused a reduction in the capacity of trains using Euston every day, he said.
Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said the changes would ""dramatically improve the design"" of the station.
Sarah Hayward, leader of Camden Council, predicted: ""HS2 will cause decades of blight in the Euston area - to property prices, to our small business' trade and to our residents' lives.""
She said the council is ""ardently opposed to the scheme"", adding it could only be a success with ""close collaboration"" between the local authority, residents and businesses.
HS2 Ltd's new plan will be submitted to Parliament next week in order to form part of the legislation which will allow phase one of High Speed 2 to go ahead.

"L/Cpl David Gwilt from Bedford, and rifleman Dale Harris from Barnsley, died in the collision near Cullybackey in August 2014.
The 24-year-olds had been serving in the 2nd Battalion The Rifles, based at Thiepval Barracks in Lisburn.
Their colleague, rifleman Matthew Robins, escaped major injury.
Mr Robins told Belfast Coroner's Court how the three had left the barracks that morning to spend some time fishing.
He said the friends had stopped at two lakes and were on the way to find another spot to fish when the accident happened.
The soldier said he recalled being in the front passenger seat of the car as they drove along, but had no memory of the crash that followed.
""The next thing I remember I was in the ambulance and a paramedic was on the phone to my missus,"" he said.
Mr Robins, also from England, later told the coroner that none of the men were familiar with the roads in that part of County Antrim.
Jordan Marks was driving the tractor and trailer along the Ballyconnelly Road at around 20:00 BST when the silver Fiat Punto owned and driven by Mr Gwilt emerged from a junction.
""I just got a sight of a car flying out of the junction,"" Mr Marks said.
The vehicle collided with the front of the tractor and spun around before crashing into a road sign.
A retired doctor and two off-duty nurses were among the first to come upon the scene of the crash.
Despite their efforts, the two soldiers were declared dead at the site. Mr Gwilt was in the driver's seat and Mr Harris was in the back passenger seat behind him.
A road traffic collision investigator said the junction at the approach to the Ballyconnelly Road was clearly marked with signs and road markings.
""The Fiat was required to stop by the road markings and signage,"" he said.
Mr Dunn said it was not possible to determine the exact speed the soldiers' car was travelling at, but added: ""It was not moving at a relatively slow speed.""
Assessing the conclusions of the expert's report, the coroner said: ""The bottom line is the car failed to stop at the junction and very tragically that led to a collision with the tractor and the deaths of the driver and passenger.""
A policeman told the coroner there had been a ""collision history"" at the junction and explained there was another side road directly opposite the road the soldiers were travelled on - giving the impression of one continuing road.
""If you weren't paying close attention you might miss the junction completely,"" he said.
The coroner heard that Transport NI has agreed to introduce additional safety measures at the junction - such as 'rumble strip' road paint to give drivers further warning to slow down and high visibility bordering around the stop signs.
The coroner welcomed the steps.
""I always hope something will arise out of a tragedy that will improve matters and may prevent the occurrence of something similar,"" he said.
Recording the deaths as being the result of a road crash, the coroner extended his sympathies to the relatives of the two soldiers and again commended all those who had attempted to save them.","Two soldiers were killed when their car failed to stop at a junction and crashed into a tractor in County Antrim, an inquest has heard.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Two spacecraft have been ordered at a cost of roughly 550m euros (Â£405m).
They will be built at the aerospace giant's factories in Portsmouth and Stevenage in southern England.
Inmarsat specialises in providing mobile connections to ships, planes, oil and gas platforms, and the broadcasting industry.
The new spacecraft will be known as the Inmarsat-6 series. They will update services currently offered in the L-band part of the radio spectrum.
These connections are handled today by the Inmarsat-4 series, which was launched in 2005. The expectation is that these earlier platforms will be operational until at least 2020, by which time the I-6s should be ready for lift-off.
Inmarsat's decision to place the order with Airbus is a major boost for UK space manufacturing.
The telecoms company is the world's biggest player in its field, and so the Airbus workers in Portsmouth and Stevenage will see the contract as a tremendous endorsement of their skills and expertise.
It will also be regarded as a very positive return on the strategy pursued by ministers and the UK Space Agency, who have targeted R&D investments in the telecoms sector.
This has seen, for example, the development of state-of-the-art digital signal processors for satellites that can channel significant bandwidth and power to specific locations on the ground at the drop of a hat.
In addition to being more capable than the I-4s, the I-6s will differ in two key respects.
One is their frequency of operation. As well as the L-band, which is where Inmarsat has many legacy services, the new satellites will carry a Ka-band payload.
This higher frequency part of the radio spectrum is where much of the new sector growth will occur - such as in-flight connections for aeroplanes.  Inmarsat recently launched an I-5 series of satellites. These all operate in Ka.
The other big difference from the I-4s, and indeed the I-5s, will be the new satellites' architecture. They will be what are called ""all-electric"" spacecraft.
This means they will use an ion engine to manoeuvre themselves once they come off the top of the launch rocket.
This is normally done with a large chemical thruster, but a significant mass saving can be made if the final orbital positioning is done using an engine that spits out a stream of charged gas.
Such ion engines, although extremely efficient, do however take longer to achieve the task in hand, resulting in a delay of several months to get the satellite on-station.
The plus side for the satellite owner is that they can use the mass saving either to select a smaller, cheaper rocket or to add additional payload capability.

Mr Beaumont will be formally installed as rector in a ceremony to be arranged for a later date.
The rector is elected to serve the students' interests, including at the University Court, the governing body of the institution.

"The Commission on Widening Access said there was an ""undeniable case for change"" on the issue.
But it acknowledged the move would be ""divisive"", with concerns that middle-class students could be displaced.
The commission was set up by the first minister last year.
It was tasked with advising the Scottish government on how best to achieve its goal of ending the big gap between the number of students from wealthy and deprived backgrounds going to university.
The commission's interim report said there had been ""steady progress"" on the issue over the past decade.
But it stressed that ""very significant socioeconomic inequalities"" remained which were ""unfair, unsustainable and detrimental to Scotland"", and said the country had a moral and economic duty to tackle the issue
The report said it had been suggested that admitting students from deprived backgrounds with lower grades could have a detrimental impact on the academic excellence of Scotland's universities.
But it stated: ""There is increasingly strong evidence that with the right support, bright students from deprived backgrounds can enhance, rather than jeopardise, academic excellence.""
The report said other opposing viewpoints included:
But it added: ""Unless we are prepared to accept the notion that Scotland's talent is concentrated in its most affluent communities, it is clear that, through accident of birth, a whole section of Scottish society has nothing like an equal opportunity to maximise their talent and reap the benefits of higher education.
""We believe that this is fundamentally unfair and that the ultimate goal of widening access should be to eliminate socioeconomic inequality.
""Equality of access is not just a passport to a better life for individuals; it is also a passport to a fairer, better Scotland.""
The report also said there was strong evidence that parental experience of higher education was one of the most influential factors in determining the likelihood of a child entering university.
It added: ""This means that equal access is capable of transmitting the social and economic benefits of higher education between generations, breaking cycles of deprivation and contributing to a society that is healthier, wealthier and fairer.
""The evidence shows that a higher education is a passport to a better life. Graduates benefit from higher wages, significantly improved health outcomes and a higher life expectancy.
""We believe that Scotland has a moral duty to ensure that these opportunities are distributed fairly.""
The commission's final report is expected to be submitted next year.
The interim report was welcomed by Education Secretary Angela Constance, who said more needed to be done to tackle inequality in education despite the progress that had been made in recent years.
A spokeswoman for Universities Scotland said: ""Contextual admissions can help with this and it is one of many tools, but definitely not a silver bullet, that universities can use to help widen access.
""Universities will always look for the best and brightest applicants - our quality and excellence is very important to us and absolutely will not be compromised - but we are open-minded about what best and brightest actually means.""","Scottish universities should consider admitting students from deprived backgrounds whose grades are lower than their more affluent counterparts, according to a report.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Scotland's chief statistician estimated services grew by 0.5% and production by 0.3% between April and June, while construction contracted by 1.9%.
UK output as a whole grew by 0.7% over the same period.
Over the past year, the Scottish economy grew by 0.7% - a third of the UK rate of 2.1%.
In the first three months of the year, there was no growth in Scotland.
Scottish GDP per person - which takes population changes into account - grew by 0.3% during the second quarter, compared with 0.4% for the UK.
The report indicated that growth in Scottish GDP over the past year was driven by growth in the services industry, particularly in business services and finance.
However, that was ""tempered"" by contractions in the construction and production industries, especially electricity and gas, following the closure in March of Scotland's last coal-fired power station.
It was estimated that the closure resulted in a reduction of Scottish GDP of about 0.2 percentage points in the second quarter.
The economic report added: ""As this was a one-off closure it will not have an ongoing impact on the growth of the Scottish economy.""
Reacting to the figures, Scottish Chambers of Commerce chief executive Liz Cameron said it was ""good news"" that Scotland's economic growth rate had increased but added that there was ""still a great deal of work to be done"".
She said: ""To put this in perspective, the Scottish economy has grown in a year at almost the same rate that the UK economy has grown in just three months.
""These figures underline the fact that Scotland's economic performance has been significantly lower than that of the UK as a whole for a full year and, whilst we are now seeing welcome growth in our production and service sectors, construction has been contracting at a significant rate for two consecutive quarters.""
Colin Borland, head of external affairs in Scotland for the Federation of Small Businesses, said: ""These pre-referendum statistics might feel like a history lesson, but they teach us that Scottish growth was weak even before June's historic vote.
""Scotland needs to strive for growth levels at least as good as the UK average.
""We look forward to the SNP talking business when they meet in Glasgow this week.
""In addition, the UK government needs to put the welfare of the economy at the top of its priority list as it formulates its approach to leaving the EU.

"The rate of deforestation has increased so much that Indonesia has for the first time surpassed Brazil in the rate of its clearance of tropical forests.
The study was published in the journal Nature Climate Change.
Scientists monitored the growth of deforested land in Indonesia between 2000 and 2012 using satellites.
They say the land was cleared to make way for palm oil plantations and other farms.
By 2012, the loss of primary forest every year in Indonesia was estimated to be higher than that in Brazil, said scientists.
In that year, Indonesia lost 8,400 sq km of forest compared to Brazil which lost 4,600 sq km.
The researchers, from the University of Maryland, said that deforestation had led to an increase in greenhouse gas emissions and a loss of biodiversity.
Indonesia has 10% of the world's plants and 12% of the world's mammals. It is known for its diverse wildlife which includes orangutans and Sumatran tigers.
A government moratorium on deforestation was signed in 2011 and was intended to slow down the pace of deforestation.
But environmental activists say corrupt politicians are quick to sell off huge swathes of rainforests for profit, and they point to the need for more monitoring and sanctions to stop the rate at which Indonesia is losing its forests, says the BBC's Karishma Vaswani.
Massive forest fires in Indonesia to clear land last year caused a heavy smog to blanket neighbouring Malaysia and Singapore, triggering health concerns in those countries.
Norway has pledged a billion dollars to Indonesia if it can prove it is serious about stopping deforestation.
Agencies report that Norway has paid almost $50 million to Indonesia to help set up new institutions to reduce deforestation.
But Indonesia will only start to get large amounts of money if deforestation is slowed down.","A new study has shown that Indonesia lost about 60,000 sq km of virgin forest - an area close to the size of Ireland - over a period of 12 years.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The 23-year-old, in his eighth Test, was dropped three times but reached an entertaining hundred from 104 balls.
England claimed two wickets in five balls early on but left-hander De Kock shared in stands of 50 and 82 and was unbeaten on 129 as his team made 475.
In reply Alex Hales fell cheaply but Alastair Cook held firm with 67.
South Africa resumed on 329-5 with De Kock on 29 and added 146 runs in 42 overs before they were bowled out midway through the afternoon session.
Media playback is not supported on this device
Fast bowler Kagiso Rabada claimed two early England wickets, trapping Nick Compton for 19 with one that pitched halfway down the wicket but hit barely above the boots.
The increasingly uneven bounce will give South Africa, who have already lost the series, hope of a consolation victory.
England's new opener Hales, playing his seventh Test innings, struck three fluent boundaries in his 15 from 14 balls, with consecutive attractive strokes to the fence through the off-side off the back foot.
But in the sixth over he skewed a loose drive, which was comfortably caught at backward point.
Former England captain Michael Vaughan told Test Match Special: ""It was a terrible dismissal. He gifted an opportunity and it is another one to put in the list of failures.
""He looks in two minds at the crease, unsure whether to go for the full-on aggressive shot or a checked drive.""
Hales, who has passed 50 only once in seven innings in the series, is the eighth opening partner for Cook since the retirement of former skipper Andrew Strauss in 2012.
The current captain showed a welcome return to form, however, looking assured in his first fifty of the series - and the 47th of his Test career - and is only 50 short of becoming the first England player to score 10,000 Test runs.
Joe Root edged a delivery fractionally short of De Kock behind the stumps as the occasional ball misbehaved but England's two leading batsmen put on 60 to take them to the close without further loss.
Having reprieved centurions Stephen Cook and Hashim Amla with dropped catches on day one, England were guilty of further errors in the field as South Africa pressed on to a commanding first innings total.
In only the third over of the day De Kock scythed James Anderson to gully where a diving Ben Stokes could not grasp the chance.
On 80, De Kock edged the luckless Chris Woakes and bisected wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow and wide first slip Alastair Cook, neither of whom went for the catch.
Ten runs later, De Kock's drive at Moeen Ali went through the hands of Cook at short extra-cover.
The left-hander played an array of shots all around the wicket and was particularly severe on Moeen Ali.
He scored 45 runs off the spinner in only 28 balls, including two mighty leg-side sixes, one of which nearly landed on a cameraman behind the long-on boundary.
Former South Africa wicketkeeper Mark Boucher: ""The pitch is not going to get any better; those cracks are going to widen. Batting from now on is going to be hard graft. In the last innings it will be a real lottery.
""You do feel that if South Africa get it right in a session, they will do some proper damage. You could have a session where England go 60-4.""
Ex-England skipper Michael Vaughan: ""There's going to be more low bounce over the next three days. You're under a lot of pressure when a team gets 475 on the board - you're only one bad session away from losing the match.

"Former party leader Mark Durkan, who has been the MP for the area since 2005, lost out by just 169 votes to Elisha McCallion of Sinn Féin.
Londonderry's city seat had been coveted by the SDLP since their party founder John Hume was elected in 1983.
All 18 of Northern Ireland's MPs have been confirmed with the SDLP and Ulster Unionist Party the biggest losers.
At the last general election in 2015, Mr Durkan was 8,000 votes clear of his nearest rival with 42% of the vote.
""I cannot tell a lie,"" he said in his concession speech.
""I cannot say it doesn't hurt but I absolutely want to begin by congratulating Elisha McCallion and agreeing with her that what she has achieved tonight is a privilege, to represent the people of this city.""
The Foyle turnout was 65.60% - up from 53.58% two years ago.
While not exactly a political newcomer, Ms McCallion only became an MLA at Stormont earlier this year following the death of Martin McGuinness.
In an emotional speech after the result, she recognised Mr Durkan's contribution to political life in the North West.
""Mark has been a public representative in Derry for a large number of years and he has served it well,"" she said. ""But I can't not express my extreme delight at being the first ever republican MP ever elected in this city.""
Mr Durkan said one of the reasons for his defeat was greater campaign funding by Sinn Féin.
He also felt that a reluctance from other parties to engage in a ""progressive alliance"" along pro-EU lines had been damaging.
""We were faced with a huge effort and a huge spend by Sinn Féin, they targeted the constituency very well and put huge resources in here,"" he told the BBC.
""It's a big part of it, if we can't match that spend or that spin.""
SDLP leader Colum Eastwood, who also hails from Derry, will now have a big job on his hands to pick the party up from their Westminster whitewash.
Stephen Pound, the Labour MP for Ealing North and shadow minister for Northern Ireland, said Mr Durkan's loss from the house of Commons would be keenly felt.
""Mark was without a doubt one of the finest speakers in the House of Commons, he was also the inventor of these incredible 'Durkanisms',"" Mr Pound told BBC Radio Foyle.
""He was one of the few people that made everybody stop rustling the papers and look up when he started speaking, he'll be missed greatly.

"It will cease operation at the end of August, after being told it would no longer receive legal aid funding.
The Legal Aid Agency (LAA) ruled the firm had breached contractual requirements.
Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said the firm's closure was the ""right outcome for our armed forces"".
The LAA took its decision after reviewing information submitted by the firm, following a Solicitors Regulation Authority investigation.
PIL, which has offices in London and Birmingham, represented complainants in the Â£31m Al-Sweady inquiry into a 2004 battle in southern Iraq.
The firm was criticised when the inquiry's 2014 report concluded that the subsequent war crimes allegations were based on ""deliberate lies, reckless speculation and ingrained hostility"".
That report concluded the behaviour of some soldiers towards detainees breached the Geneva convention, but was highly critical of the claims it was initially set up to investigate.
These were that Iraqi detainees had been murdered, mutilated and tortured following the Battle of Danny Boy on 14 May 2004 near Al Amarah in southern Iraq.
The report found that British forces responded to a deadly ambush by insurgents with ""exemplary courage, resolution and professionalism"".
And it suggested some detainees - all described as members or supporters of the Mahdi Army insurgent group - lied about the most serious allegations, so as to discredit the British armed forces.
In 2010 PIL called for a full public inquiry into allegations made by 142 Iraqi civilians that they were abused by British soldiers in southern Iraq.
The firm's lead lawyer Phil Shiner said that the case ""raises a number of very troubling systemic issues about the practices and techniques used on Iraqis"".
He also called for a single inquiry into the UK's detention policy in Iraq.
In January 2014 PIL submitted a legal bid with the International Criminal Court to prosecute British politicians and senior military figures, for alleged war crimes in Iraq - a move which the then Foreign Secretary William Hague said should be rejected. It submitted the bid along with the European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights.
Speaking at the time, Mr Shiner said the move was ""about individual criminal accountability for war crimes"".
It led to an initial investigation into claims that UK forces abused Iraqi detainees being opened by the ICC.
And in September 2015 PIL and the ECCHR submitted further evidence, which the ICC says added ""substantively to the allegations... expanding the list of alleged crimes in relation to new cases of alleged detainee abuses"".
Mr Fallon said the UK's armed forces ""show bravery and dedication in difficult circumstances"".
""For too long, we've seen our legal system abused to impugn them falsely. We are now seeing progress and we will be announcing further measures to stamp out this practice.""
A Number 10 spokesman said: ""We made a manifesto commitment to addressing these types of spurious claims that companies like PIL are pursuing.
""The closure of PIL shows that we are making progress on that, tackling these types of firms head on to make sure we get the right outcome for our armed forces who show such bravery in the most difficult of circumstances.""
The spokesman also said ministers were considering a ""suite of measures"" to prevent firms making bogus claims, including strengthening the penalties for abusers of the system.","The law firm Public Interest Lawyers, which submitted multiple allegations of misconduct by British troops during the Iraq War, is to close.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Patricia O'Donnell, head of Clarksfield Primary School, Oldham, also alleged she had received death threats.
Oldham Council said it investigated the claims made in December but concluded, in a report leaked to the Sunday Times, it had ""no concerns"" about any schools.
The report would remain confidential, the council said.
Councillor Amanda Chadderton, cabinet member for education and early years, said: ""We take any allegations about our schools very seriously and always investigate in the interests of pupils, staff and parents.
""The report into an Oldham primary school found no basis to 'Trojan Horse' allegations.""
The Sunday Times story also referred to a counter-extremism official raising concerns over two other schools in Oldham - Horton Mill and Oldham Academy North.
Ms Chadderton added: ""At this time, we also have no active investigations or concerns about any of the other schools the Sunday Times has asked about.""
The Department for Education said: ""We are already aware of the allegations raised in the report and we are working closely with Oldham Council.""

"Statistics gained under the Freedom of Information Act show nine councils have reduced how much they plan to spend.
It has led to concern that vulnerable groups are denied support some carers call ""light at the end of the tunnel"".
The Welsh Government said it was up to councils to ensure they had necessary respite placements.
According to figures provided by 21 of the 22 local authorities to BBC Wales, cuts have been made to defined respite budgets in Blaenau Gwent, Ceredigion, Neath Port Talbot, Newport, Swansea and Torfaen.
In Carmarthenshire, Conwy and Monmouthshire, the overall residential care budget, which includes provision for respite, has been cut.
In several other counties the budget for respite in 2011-12 was up on last year, but in some cases represented a cut on previous years.
No figures were provided by Anglesey council.
The figures show Swansea Council has cut its internal provision respite budget for older people and younger adults by over 80% in the last two years.
In 2009-10 it spent over £680,000, but this year the budget is less that £108,000.
Director of social services Chris Maggs admits the council is operating in a tough financial climate, but insists the changes will improve choice.
""We're faced with some incredible challenges as local authorities, and we obviously need to look at how we use all of our resources."" said Mr Maggs.
The council has decided to transfer money from respite care into its own residential homes, who will provide short breaks in the future.
""What we're doing is re-using our money,"" he said.
""Whilst it is true that we're reducing the total amount of money, we're also improving the range of services we have by using our existing services in a different way, so it maximises what we've actually got.""
But the potential changes have angered some families who depend on respite care.
Suzanne Hayes, from Rhossili, near Swansea, is a carer for her 27-year-old stepson John, who has cerebral palsy.
She described the six weeks of respite allocation they are given every year as ""light at the end of a tunnel"", but she feels strongly that the family need more support.
""John needs to have breaks because he can mix with different people,"" she said.
""We live in a beautiful area, but it is very isolating for John.""
The short respite breaks also give the family time to recover while John is away.
""It's not the big things, it's going for a coffee. It's having your own knife and fork in your hands, because we have to feed John.""
According to the charity Carers Wales, respite provision is already in short supply, but the cuts being made by local authorities will limit support even further.
""For individual families if a respite service which they've relied on gets cut, that's a real problem,"" said director Roz Williamson.
""But for most families, the problem is that they can't get access to anything - so the qualification for getting any help from a local authority keeps going up and up and up - so most families get nothing.""
A consultation on the future of respite care in Wales has recently closed, following an independent review which said there was ""a strong case for funding more outcome focussed respite services in Wales"".
The Welsh Government said it recognised ""the important role that respite care has in supporting individuals and families at what can be an extremely difficult time"".
A spokesperson said: ""We are protecting the social services budget through the local government settlement. Funding for social services will increase in cash terms by £35m by 2013-14.

"He was told about the political revenge plot at a 9/11 memorial service two days after the lanes were blocked, a former aide testified in federal court.
David Wildstein, who pleaded guilty to the scheme last year, recounted his discussion with Mr Christie on Tuesday.
The New Jersey governor has repeatedly denied knowing about the lane closures.
Mr Wildstein, who worked at the Port Authority of New York & New Jersey, said he and his boss, Bill Baroni, told Mr Christie that Mark Sokolich, the mayor of Fort Lee, was ""frustrated"" over the lane closures.
Mr Christie allegedly laughed and responded in a sarcastic tone: ""I would imagine that he wouldn't be getting his phone calls returned.""
The Port Authority oversees airports, tunnels and bridges in the New York area.
The fall and fall of Chris Christie
Mr Wildstein testified on Tuesday against Mr Baroni and Bridget Anne Kelly, the governor's former deputy chief of staff.
The two former aides are charged with conspiring to misuse Port Authority property to punish Mayor Sokolich, a Democrat.
Mr Christie, who was once considered a favourite for the Republican presidential nominations, first became embroiled in the scandal in January 2014, when revelations from a series of emails and texts showed that traffic congestion on the George Washington Bridge may have been more than just routine maintenance.
Mr Christie's administration justified the closures as part of a traffic study, but Port Authority officials later said the study did not exist.
The congestion ended after five days, when an aide to New York's Democratic Governor Andrew Cuomo reopened the lanes over concerns of public safety.
Federal prosecutors opened an investigation and indicted three members of Mr Christie's aides in 2015, alleging that two of the key bridge's three lanes were closed in retaliation over Mayor Soklich's refusal to endorse the governor in his re-election bid.
The governor was not charged in connection to the scheme and has denied any involvement.
Mr Wildstein avoided going to trial by pleading guilty to charges of conspiracy to commit fraud on a federally funded property and a civil rights violation.
Ms Kelly and Mr Baroni have pleaded not guilty to the charges.
Mr Wildstein's dramatic testimony follows weeks of renewed questions over whether Mr Christie was aware of the political retribution.
After the governor dropped out of the Republican primary race earlier this year, concerns over ""Bridgegate"" were overshadowed by his surprising move to endorse his former rival, Donald Trump, for the White House.
But last week, federal prosecutors alleged that the governor was informed of the plot, using Mr Wildstein's testimony to argue their claim.
Prosecutors revealed photographs of Mr Wildstein, Mr Baroni and the governor laughing together at the 2013 memorial service, suggesting that they were taken during the conversation about the bridge closure.
At an event in Trenton, New Jersey later on Tuesday, the governor again denied any knowledge.
""I had no knowledge prior to or during"" the closures, he said. ""There's been no evidence ever put forward that I did.
Mr Wildstein's testimony follows last month's revelations that former Christie ally Christina Renna allegedly texted her colleague, Peter Sheridan, about the governor's knowledge of the plot.
""He just flat out lied about senior staff and [former campaign manager Bill Stepien] not being involved,"" she allegedly texted, referring to comments Mr Christie made during a news conference that year.
Republicans are probably thanking their lucky stars - as much as they can these days - that Donald Trump didn't go with what was reportedly his gut instinct and pick Chris Christie to be his vice-presidential running mate.
If the New Jersey governor had ended up on the ticket, the party would be facing a huge ""Bridgegate"" distraction on the eve of the one and only vice-presidential debate.
Of more proximate concern for Mr Christie at this point is that the latest revelations will make it increasingly difficult for him to have any sort of high-profile job in a possible Trump administration.
He would likely be savaged by the Senate if he stood for confirmation for a Cabinet position such as attorney general.
Given that the unpopular Christie has little future in New Jersey elective politics, the ""Bridgegate"" trial could be closing his only lane to continued political relevance.","New Jersey Governor Chris Christie laughed about his staff closing part of a bridge in 2013 over a mayor who refused to endorse him, a court heard.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But Paddington is the politest of bears and would surely never say anything bad, right?
However, the family adventure about a talking bear has been awarded a PG certificate instead of a U. Here's why:
Okay, this is putting it a bit strongly, but the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) has said that there is some ""mild innuendo"" in the film.
Enough to warrant an appearance on Scott Mills's Innuendo Bingo? Probably not.
But there's one sequence highlighted by the BBFC where ""a man disguised as a woman is flirted with by another man.""
Let's be honest unless you're a Paddington superfan, have children or have a teddy bear obsession, you're probably not going to go and see this film.
It's primarily been made for kids - and it follows that kids copy things they see on the big screen.
So what are the BBFC trying to stop these impressionable young viewers from doing?
Well, there's one scene where ""Paddington (is) hiding from a villain inside a refrigerator.""
But turning Paddington from a chilly bear in to a polar bear isn't the board's only concern.
Our loveable hero is also seen ""riding on a skateboard while holding onto a bus, as well as a brief scene of a boy strapping fireworks to his shoes.""
Who would possibly want to hurt a cute, cuddly bear like Paddington? Nicole Kidman, that's who.
The Australian actress plays the film's villain and she's out to ""kill and stuff"" Paddington.
And (spoiler alert), she comes close too. Viewers will see our pawed protagonist spread unconscious on a table, while an evil taxidermist prepares tools nearby.
But it's not just in London that Paddington needs to keep his wits about him.
""There is also a short scene in a jungle when Paddington and his family run for shelter during an earthquake with trees falling around them,"" according to the BBFC.
On the whole Paddington is as sweet as the marmalade he devours.
His manners are immaculate, barring the odd dining table faux pas, but there is one solitary ""mumbled use of 'bloody'"" which is enough to cause concern for the BBFC.
Contrary to other reports, the BBFC has told Newsbeat that Paddington was always classified as a PG film and has not been upgraded from a ""U"" certificate.
The board defended its decision and said its guidelines are reviewed every four to five years.
""The most recent review of the guidelines, in 2013, involved more than 10,000 member of the public from across the UK.
""The 2013 review found that 92% of film viewers agreed with the classification of films and videos they had seen recently.""

Linda's mother, Lorna Norgrove, said: ""We were hugely impressed by what this project is doing for women's empowerment in Afghanistan. News of their achievements has already reached more than 4 million Afghan women and the project is changing the lives of these young women for ever.
""I think the project particularly resonated with us because as a family we are all keen hillwalkers and climbers.
""We know Linda would have loved this project and we're sure that it will appeal to the many people in the UK who enjoy climbing the hills and mountains. We take for granted the freedom to climb the hills, but this is something which can change lives for these young women in Afghanistan.""

"The four-piece group and their manager, who were aged between 19 and 32, died in the early hours of 13 February following a gig in Stockholm.
Their car crashed into a raised section of a bridge and plummeted into a canal.
The inquest heard no alcohol or drugs was found in the blood of manager Craig Tarry, 32, who was driving.
Post-mortem examinations also showed the four band members had not taken drugs and had only consumed small amounts of alcohol.
The band's agent Graham Bennett told the inquest at Warrington Coroner's Court that the up-and-coming group were in Sweden for a festival showcasing young artists.
Viola Beach had already played at the Reading and Leeds festivals last year and the Stockholm event was their first gig outside the UK.
After the performance, they were travelling in a black Nissan Qashqai near the SÃ¶dertÃ¤lje Canal, about 18 miles from the capital, when a bridge was raised to let a boat pass underneath.
The inquest heard that the car was slightly over the speed limit as it was travelling at 108km/h (67mph) in a 100km/h zone.
Flashing lights signalled that the bridge was about to be raised with the middle section of the road lifted horizontally, the inquest heard.
Mr Tarry drove down a verge past stationary queuing traffic and through the first set of barriers, about 120m from the bridge, the court heard.
The car then travelled in a ""controlled manner"" at between 70 and 90km/h down the centre of the road.
It continued through a second set of barriers - 30m from the drop into the canal - and hit the raised section of the bridge before plummeting 25m, hitting the water within 15 seconds.
The court heard a tanker using the canal, which had requested the bridge to be lifted, then passed over the crash spot and ""contact"" with the car could not be ruled out.
The crew of a passing boat saw the car fall but initially thought it was ice.
Technical examinations did not find any errors with the car, barrier system or the procedure for raising the bridge.
One warning light on the bridge was out of order but there were at least 10 warning lights and flashing signals, the inquest heard.
Although the road was wet, it was not frozen with ice.
Post-mortem examinations found that all died from head injuries apart from Mr Lowe whose cause of death was given as drowning.
The court heard that the three band members sitting in the back of the car were not wearing seatbelts but those in the front were, and had to be cut from the vehicle.
Cheshire Coroner Nicholas Rheinberg said ""none of the young men will have suffered"" as they died.
The Swedish authorities have recommended improvements to the crossing, including LED signs and cameras on the bridge.
In the wake of their deaths, the band's first single Swings & Waterslides reached number 11, while their song Boys That Sing was performed by Coldplay in a tribute at Glastonbury.
Posthumously, Viola Beach scored a number one album in August.
The self-titled debut was compiled by the band's families, using live sessions and studio recordings, many of which were originally bound for an EP.
After the crash, a statement from the families of the band said: ""We are tremendously proud of everything the boys achieved in such a short space of time.
""Craig, Jack, Kris, River and Tom shared a huge passion, talent and dedication to music.""","An inquest into the deaths of British band Viola Beach after a crash in Sweden has heard that ""none of the young men will have suffered"".",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The new rates will be implemented in October and will benefit a million workers.
Business Secretary Vince Cable said he had accepted a recommendation from the Low Pay Commission that the minimum wage should increase by 3%.
It is the first time in six years that the rise will be higher than inflation.
The rate for 18 to 20-year-olds will go up by 10p to £5.13 an hour, a 2% increase.
The rate for those aged 16 and 17 will rise by 7p to £3.79, also a 2% rise.
Apprentices will earn an extra 5p an hour, taking their wages to at least £2.73.
The consumer prices index (CPI) rate of inflation is currently 1.9%.
""The recommendations I have accepted today mean that low-paid workers will enjoy the biggest cash increase in their take-home pay since 2008,"" said Mr Cable.
He also suggested that all companies should consider helping their staff to share in the fruits of an improving economy.
""I urge businesses to consider how all their staff - not just those on the minimum wage - can enjoy the benefits of recovery,"" he said.
Meanwhile, the man who set up the minimum wage 15 years ago, said it is in need of major reform.
Professor Sir George Bain, founding chair of the Low Pay Commission, said the benchmark was a ""child of its times"" when launched in 1999.
But speaking to BBC Newsnight on Wednesday, he said it had become a ""blunt instrument"" and that many employers could now afford to pay their workers much more.
""If you set it at the 'living wage', which is about £7.65 an hour, you would cause massive unemployment in areas like retail and social care,"" Sir George added.
""But there's only about five sectors where this is true. There's a whole range of sectors where you could easily afford to pay more than the minimum wage.""
Sir George, who has chaired a review of the minimum wage for think-tank the Resolution Foundation, also said there should be a ""special case for London to have a higher national minimum"".
His report also recommends that the Low Pay Commission give longer-term forecasts for the benchmark, to help employers plan for the future.
The latest rise means the national minimum wage is still well below the definition of low pay, as set by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).
This equates to two-thirds of the median full-time hourly wage - about £7.71 an hour. About five million UK workers currently earn below that level.
The latest figure is also well below the living wage, which is £8.80 per hour in London, and £7.65 in the rest of the country.
""Across the country, people are struggling to make ends meet,"" said Dave Prentice, the head of the Unison trade union.
""The sooner we move to a living wage, the better,"" he said.
In January this year, Chancellor George Osborne said he backed the idea of the national minimum wage reaching £7 an hour by October 2015.
The latest announcement could pave the way for that to happen, but it would need a rise of more than 7% next year to do so.
Unite, the country's biggest trade union, said the rise announced was ""timid"".
""To make matters even worse, George Osborne cruelly held out hope that the rate would rise to £7,"" said Len McCluskey, Unite's general secretary.
""The government claims it is on the side of working people but companies are sitting on a cash mountain of £500bn and they should be forced to share more of it with the lowest paid,"" he added.","The national minimum wage will increase by 19p an hour to £6.50, the government has announced.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But with the lowest turnout in the constituency's history and a margin of 2,620 the narrowest ever recorded in this once proud Labour heartland, can this declaration really be believed?
It's a bright and windy day in Stoke-on-Trent.
The town has been at the centre of the political spotlight for weeks now, but people seem more interested in discussing the aftermath of Storm Doris than the small matter of Stoke Central's by-election result.
This staunch working class community was once passionately behind Labour.
In 1951, more than 60,000 went to the polls - 34,260 backing Labour.
Rather than feel victorious about Gareth Snell's win, Labour voters willing to talk simply seem relieved Paul Nuttall didn't clinch it.
In all, 7,853 voted for Mr Snell, compared to 5,233 who wanted UKIP to win.
Wendy Wright, 51, from Newcastle-under-Lyme, thought the vote for UKIP may have been higher had it not been for its disastrous campaign.
""I'm not surprised Labour won because of the way UKIP handled the campaign,"" she said.
""The people of Stoke seemed to think he [Paul Nuttall] didn't come from the area and they didn't believe his pack of lies.
""It's a relief UKIP didn't get in but [Labour retaining the seat] just means things are going to stay the same.""
Ms Wright said there had not been a high turnout because ""people aren't interested in politics"".
She said: ""They've kind of lost faith and lost hope. They think, what's the point, nothing's going to change.
""It's a deprived area and it's a shame because the people are so welcoming and friendly.""
Veronica Millington, 71, from Blythe Bridge, said she and husband Anthony, 75, were ""Labour through and through"".
They backed Mr Snell in the by-election and also voted to stay in the European Union.
""I think the people of Stoke do care about politics and they want to make things better,"" she said.
""I think they were misled by UKIP in the beginning. They seemed to promise them so much and people saw it as a new chance really.
""It was only when all the lies came out they saw how many wrong things had been said.""
Mr Millington, 75, expressed concern about why so few people bothered to go to the polls.
""The turnout seemed to be very low and I think a lot of people think it was a foregone conclusion.
""They thought the Labour Party would win. Now whether or not they've had a jolt from the outsider now, I don't know.""
For a city that has had such a strong relationship with the Labour party, the changing political landscape over the past seven decades reveals a lot about the strength of feeling in the community.
Labour has won all 18 elections since since the inception of the Stoke Central constituency, with the Conservatives coming second until 2001.
But although Labour enjoyed a heyday in the 1960s and 70s, their share of the vote has consistently fallen over the years down to a record low of 37% in this by-election.
So why did this city of proud, working class voters fall out of love with Labour?
""Things started to change because of a growing alienation of the people of Stoke-on-Trent from Westminster,"" says Prof Mick Temple from Staffordshire University.
""Industry was decimated in the 1980s - coal, steel and the Potteries.
""When I first came here [in the early 90s] infrastructure was poor, schools were poor and still today, unemployment is higher than the national average.""
From the closure of Shelton Steel Works - where 10,000 once worked - to the shrinking of its famous pottery industry, the people of Stoke-on-Trent have lived through some turbulent times.
But the bleak images of derelict factories and houses often shown by the media are not a true reflection of the passion and pride of a community that is fiercely proud of its heritage.
Data shows 6.2% of adults in Stoke Central claim unemployment benefit, far higher than the national average of 3.8%.
In recent years employers such as Bet365, Michelin Tyres and Goodwin have invested millions of pounds into their businesses, providing jobs for thousands of people.
Hanley's famous pottery industry is also enjoying something of a resurgence, with Emma Bridgewater investing more than Â£1m in its thriving ceramics factory.
Middleport Pottery, home of world-famous Burleigh, is in the national spotlight thanks to the success of BBC Two's The Great Pottery Throw Down.
Millions of pounds are being spent regenerating the city.
For many people though, the investment has been too little, too late.
""The feeling is that the city has been passed by Westminster and the EU, and that is why people voted Leave so overwhelmingly,"" says Prof Temple.
""There are many towns in the north of England where people feel the same - areas that are ripe for UKIP.""
From 2005, the BNP and UKIP began to resonate with voters, coming fourth and fifth in that year's election and again in 2010.
By 2015, UKIP had won so much support its candidate Mick Harold came second to Tristram Hunt for a seat that had the lowest voter turnout in the whole of the UK.
Pub owner Tony Flackett, 69, backed Paul Nuttall in Thursday's poll.
""It feels sad, it's such a shame, they've worked really hard and people have come from all over the country.
""I've always voted for Conservatives but the last two years I voted UKIP because of Brexit and immigration.
""But life goes on and at least they reduced the margin.""
Tom Wilson, 26, voted for UKIP in the by-election and said he was ""very upset"" at the result.
""I think Labour winning is very bad news for Stoke-on-Trent.
""There has been years of neglect in Stoke with money spent only on Hanley.
""I think only UKIP would have made a change for the people of Stoke.""
UKIP has made moves to appeal to former Labour voters, as well as those who formerly backed the Tories.
""They're more pro-State, pro-NHS. They recognise that strong nationalistic message supported by the working class,"" says Prof Temple.
Between the 2001 and 2011 Censuses, the non-white population doubled and there was a relatively high population of Muslims, he said.
""I'm not saying the response was a racist one - Stoke-on-Trent was getting less and less money from the government and the EU and the feeling was the traditional working class community was being overtaken.
""Many working class voters felt they could not express their views within the Labour party.
""The BNP and UKIP gave them a chance to say how they felt.""
Now Mr Snell is the town's new MP, the challenge is on for him to win back the trust of former Labour supporters and engage with new ones.
Lee Woolrich, 33, from Stoke-on-Trent, is head of client services for a digital agency but did not vote in the by-election.
""I'm ashamed really that I didn't use my vote, but I almost don't think I invest enough in politics to make an informed decision,"" he said.
""I don't think young people are engaged in politics. I think they are more so recently because of what's happened in America.
""I read about Paul Nuttall and some of his views and policies and I don't believe it's what we need here.""
Mr Woolrich believes politicians need to take more of an interest in Stoke-on-Trent - he too feels the place has been forgotten and is badly represented by the media.
""Stoke is doing great without those kinds of ideas.
""I love the developments in Hanley and the cultural quarter.
""Stoke is showing signs of change and getting in line with cities like Manchester.
""On a local level, I like the direction things are going in but I don't necessarily think government in London will listen to the people of Stoke.
""I hate that stigma that Stoke isn't a nice place to live.
""It doesn't do the place justice. It's a beautiful city steeped in history.""
And Prof Temple agrees. ""It's a much more attractive place,"" he said.
""I've been here for 24 years, I've lived all around the world and this is the friendliest, most coherent community I've ever known.
""Stoke-on-Trent has an identity most places in the UK have lost.
""There's a very strong sense of community. It's a place where friendship and family is still strong.""","In the wake of his victory, Stoke Central's new Labour MP Gareth Snell claimed it had been a triumph for the ""politics of hope"".",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Under-20s coach Murty has been in charge for three Premiership matches following Mark Warburton's departure.
And his side responded to defeats at Dundee and Inverness CT by beating St Johnstone 3-2 at Ibrox for his first Premiership win in charge.
""He's been brilliant,"" said midfielder Hyndman, who scored the late winner again Saints on Wednesday night.
""It's always a tough position as a kind of interim manager, especially with the way things have gone,"" on-loan Bournemouth midfielder Hyndman added.
""But I credit him for coming in and establishing what he wants us to do. I think the boys got behind him quite well.
""The results didn't really show what he was doing and how good he was but it was nice to give him that positive feeling on Wednesday night.""
Rangers are expected to appoint a new head coach next week, after Saturday's Scottish Cup quarter-final at home to Hamilton Academical.
And with the Premiership gap between third-placed Rangers and second-placed Aberdeen now cut to six points, USA international Hyndman says there is still plenty to play for this term.
""Of course there is,"" he said. ""We saw the Aberdeen result the other night (1-0 defeat at Hamilton) but we're just focused on ourselves at the same time.
""We need to get ourselves right and I think we took our first step against Saints. It was about the three points, it wasn't about how we got it.
""After recent results we've had it was very important we got three points on the board and thankfully we did that.""
Fellow loan player Jon Toral, who joined Rangers from Arsenal in January, was also keen to praise Murty.
""It was massive for Graeme on Wednesday,"" said the Spaniard. ""He has put a lot of effort into the other games as well, he has really helped us and for us to give him that first league win was crucial.
""At the minute we are just thinking about the cup tie on Saturday and then whatever happens happens. If a new manager has until the end of the season to work with the players and then to kick on next season it would be great for the club.""",Emerson Hyndman believes interim Rangers boss Graeme Murty deserves huge credit for the job he has done.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A report by technology news site Gizmodo said staff responsible for what was shown to Facebook's 1.6bn users frequently chose to bury articles they did not agree with.
Responding to the allegations, the network's head of search Tom Stocky wrote that the site ""found no evidence that the anonymous allegations are true"".
The claims come weeks after Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg publicly denounced the policies of likely US presidential nominee, Donald Trump.
""I hear fearful voices calling for building walls and distancing people they label as 'others.',"" the 31-year-old said at his firm's recent developers conference.
However, Facebook insisted Mr Zuckerberg's view did not influence what stories are given added visibility on the network.
The Trending Topics column appears in the top right corner of a typical Facebook page. It is designed to highlight what subjects are being discussed heavily by Facebook users around the world.
Facebook explained in a statement that this list was edited by humans so as to avoid regularly recurring popular topics - such as ""lunch"".
Facebook's Mr Stocky explained: ""Popular topics are first surfaced by an algorithm, then audited by review team members to confirm that the topics are in fact trending news in the real world and not, for example, similar-sounding topics or misnomers.""
The Gizmodo story, which quoted a person it said they had been one of the editors, alleged Facebook staff were routinely tampering with Trending Topic stories.
Gizmodo's source added that staff were told to seek out stories published on the BBC, CNN and other mainstream sites ahead of publications with a clearly stated political bias - even if the stories originated on those smaller outlets.
Also, if several mainstream media sites were covering the same story, Facebook would - according to the source - artificially place it in the Trending Topic column, even if it was not being discussed heavily by users.
Breitbart, one of the leading conservative news sources in the US, said the reports confirmed what they had ""long suspected"", that ""Facebook's trending news artificially mutes conservatives and amplifies progressives"".
The anonymous source also claimed that stories staff favoured - such as the Black Lives Matter movement - were given artificially greater prominence. Facebook said that this was ""untrue"".
After a day of growing reports across social media and in conservative-leaning publications, Facebook's Mr Stocky posted a response on his profile.
""We have in place strict guidelines for our trending topic reviewers as they audit topics surfaced algorithmically,"" he wrote.
""Reviewers are required to accept topics that reflect real world events, and are instructed to disregard junk or duplicate topics, hoaxes, or subjects with insufficient sources.
""Facebook does not allow or advise our reviewers to systematically discriminate against sources of any ideological origin and we've designed our tools to make that technically not feasible.
""At the same time, our reviewers' actions are logged and reviewed, and violating our guidelines is a fireable offense.""

Grantown cannot be reached by train today, but on 3 August's anniversary a steam locomotive will pull a train from Aviemore as far as Broomhill.
Passengers wearing Victorian clothing will travel free.

Major Peake added that he was now into the final phase of training, in which he was focusing on the essentials.
He said astronaut training had been rigorous and involved retaining immense quantities of information.
Tim Peake is the first Briton to be selected as an astronaut for the European Space Agency, through a route backed by the UK government.
He was in Houston, Texas, when he spoke live to schoolchildren at Queen's Park Primary School in West London. The event was organised as part of a UK Space Agency programme called Esero, which is designed to use space to help enhance science education.
""I'm immensely proud to be British and to be serving in the European Space Agency,"" he told BBC News.
""It's always very apparent to me, wherever I'm travelling, whether it be Houston, here, or Russia, that you're wearing the flag and you're representing your country.""
Major Peake, who was a British Army helicopter pilot before his selection for the astronaut corps, is set to fly to the International Space Station in December on a Russian Soyuz rocket.
He will be accompanied on the launch from Baikonur Cosmodrome by the American astronaut Timothy Kopra and the Russian Yuri Malenchenko.
The Briton said the training was now ""ramping up"" as the 15 December launch date approached.
""The training is a long process and we've covered such a huge variety of subjects. One of the main challenges is actually being able to retain all of that information over a two-and-a-half-year period,"" he said.
""I'm in the final six months before launch and we're just focusing on the essentials of the Soyuz spacecraft, emergency training... and scientific payloads that are going to be on the space station.""

Major Peake believes the flight will bring significant benefits to the country and British industry.
""This is a step forward in that it's the UK government supporting human spaceflight,"" he explained.
""What that means is that UK industry, UK education and the UK scientific community can now embrace human spaceflight.

"It means BP will have to make the payments that stem from the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig.
BP argued that the deal meant it could fall prey to inflated or bogus compensation claims.
BP agreed to the compensation deal in 2012, but argues it has been misinterpreted.
Shares in BP fell 1.7% in London on Monday.
BP asked the Supreme Court to consider whether people and businesses seeking payments under the settlement included individuals who had not actually suffered any injury as a result of the oil spill.
The Supreme Court's rejection of this appeal by BP is the latest in a series of setbacks for the oil firm.
BP is trying to limit payments over the environmental disaster, which claimed the lives of 11 people and became the largest US offshore oil spill in history.
The settlement agreement has no cap, but BP initially estimated that it would pay roughly $7.8bn (Â£6.1bn) to compensate victims.
It now says it can no longer give a reliable estimate for how much the deal will cost.
BP has already paid out $2.3bn in so-called business economic loss claims out of a total of $4.25bn in compensation claims to individuals and businesses, according to Patrick Juneau, the administrator appointed by the courts to handle claims.
The settlement process is also separate from other court proceedings relating to the spill, including environmental and criminal penalties.
BP has set aside $43bn to resolve all claims.

The revamp was originally scheduled to end in 2026 but the firm now says it will finish in 2033.
Camden Council has warned the extended works will ""blight"" the area, but HS2 says it will be ""easier to manage"".
The station is set to gain six new platforms and an additional concourse, with building works due to start in 2017.
In a change to plans submitted two years ago, HS2 Ltd has proposed the construction of five further platforms within the existing station should be delayed.
They would be ready for phase two of HS2 which will run from the capital to Leeds and Manchester in 2033.
Rupert Walker, Euston development director of HS2 Ltd, said: ""It is more construction over a longer period but it's less intense. It will be easier for us to manage.""
The impact of building all 11 platforms in one go would have caused a reduction in the capacity of trains using Euston every day, he said.
Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said the changes would ""dramatically improve the design"" of the station.
Sarah Hayward, leader of Camden Council, predicted: ""HS2 will cause decades of blight in the Euston area - to property prices, to our small business' trade and to our residents' lives.""
She said the council is ""ardently opposed to the scheme"", adding it could only be a success with ""close collaboration"" between the local authority, residents and businesses.

"Plans for a £41m revamp of the central London street, including a daylight ban on cars six days a week, were approved by Camden Council in 2014.

"Mr Miliband called the prime minister's refusal to take part unless the Green Party was involved a ""pathetic excuse"".
He said he would debate with ""anyone invited by the broadcasters"".
But Mr Cameron said the Labour leader was ""chickening"" out of facing the Greens and all ""national parties"" must be represented.
The exchanges came after Mr Miliband, Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg and UKIP leader Nigel Farage urged broadcasters to press ahead with televised debates before the 7 May poll even if Mr Cameron refuses to take part.
The three leaders have written to Mr Cameron saying it would be ""unacceptable"" for the prime minister to refuse to appear, saying an empty podium should be provided in his absence.
In response, the BBC, Sky News, ITV and Channel 4 said they ""remain committed"" to staging debates before the poll on 7 May.
Raising the issue in Parliament, Mr Miliband said Mr Cameron had argued back in 2010 that it would be ""feeble"" for any party leader to walk away from the debates but was now threatening to do just that.
A high stakes poker game in which the ultimate prize is power - that is what the row about TV leaders election debate has now become.
The players at the table are not just the nation's party leaders but also the bosses of the country's biggest broadcasters.
Watching and waiting are highly paid lawyers who know that this may end up being resolve by a judge and not by the court of public opinion.
The question is - will anyone blink before it gets to the court-room?

""It is not for him, it is not for me, it is not for any party leader to decide who is in the debate,"" he said. ""It is up to the broadcasters, that is the country we live in.
""I think he does protest too much. He has run out of excuses, he is running scared of these debates and in the words of his heroine Margaret Thatcher 'he is frit'"".
Mr Cameron said Mr Miliband wanted ""to debate having a debate"" because he did not want to talk about the economy and other issues.
He said he was keen to defend his record during the campaign, suggesting he would support the idea of two debates, one a head-to-head encounter between him and Mr Miliband and another in which all ""national parties"" were represented.
""The more time he and I can spend on television and in the television studio, the happier I will be,"" he said.
But Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, who was sitting next to the prime minister, was heard shouting ""excuses, excuses"" as Mr Cameron answered one of Mr Miliband's questions.
In identical letters to Mr Cameron, Mr Miliband, Mr Clegg and Mr Farage called for a repeat of the 2010 debates - the first ever leaders' TV debates in a British election - and insisted they ""not the property of the politicians"".
They wrote: ""I believe it would be a major setback to our democratic processes if these debates were not repeated in 2015 because of one politician's unwillingness to participate.""
The added: ""Therefore, if you are unwilling to reconsider, the three party leaders who have committed to participate will ask the broadcasters to press ahead with the debates and provide an empty podium should you have a last-minute change of heart.""
Under plans put forward by the BBC, Sky News, ITV and Channel 4 in October, the pre-election live TV debates would include the Conservatives, Labour, Liberal Democrats and UKIP.
Mr Cameron would take on Labour leader Mr Miliband head-to-head in one debate, another would feature Mr Cameron, Mr Miliband and Lib Dem leader Mr Clegg, and a third would also include UKIP's Mr Farage.
The suggested schedule is for debates on 2 April, 16 April and 30 April, ahead of the general election on 7 May.
Mr Farage said the BBC would be ""within its rights"", under the terms of its editorial guidelines, to stage a debate without Mr Cameron and providing an empty podium would be ""entirely appropriate"".
""If David Cameron chooses not to turn up that is his hard luck,"" he told the BBC News Channel. ""My guess is that if the broadcasters hold firm, Mr Cameron will buckle and say yes.""
Lord Ashdown, who is leading the Lib Dems' general election campaign, urged broadcasters to ""stick to their guns"" or else he feared the impetus for the debates would ""ebb away"".
He told Sky News: ""You just can't let the prime minister or anybody else basically hold the country and our democracy to ransom by saying no.""
But Green Party leader Natalie Bennett said she backed Mr Cameron's stance and said it was in the interest of the three other leaders to help persuade broadcasters that her party should be included in one of the debates.
Ms Bennett said ITV had not yet made a final decision and she hoped to hold talks with the broadcaster in the near future.
""Staging the debates without the prime minister might score a point but would not serve the public, who rightly expect the political parties and the broadcasters to find a format that is acceptable to all concerned,"" she wrote in a letter to the trio.
""If you indicated that you were open to the inclusion of the Greens, then I feel sure that ITV would respond.""
John Curtice, professor of politics at the University of Strathclyde, said that having ""nailed his colours to the mast"" over the Green Party's participation, it would be difficult for Mr Cameron to shun the debates if they were invited.
The three debates in 2010 were watched by a total of 22 million people, and they have been cited as one reason for the increase in turnout at the election, which rose for the first time since 1992.
While the debates were a ""good test of political leadership"", Prof Curtice told the BBC that they had dominated the campaign and ""not necessarily succeeded in reaching out to more marginal voters"".
The SNP and Plaid Cymru, which have more seats in Parliament than either UKIP or the Green Party, also say they should be represented in any series of debates.
SNP deputy leader Stuart Hosie said: ""The idea that the SNP, bigger than UKIP and the Lib Dems combined in terms of membership, should be excluded from debates which are broadcast into people's homes in Scotland is just simply quite unacceptable.""
In a statement, the four broadcasters said: ""The debates played an important role in informing millions of our viewers in 2010 and we will continue to work with all the parties to ensure that they happen again in 2015"".
The Guardian, Daily Telegraph and YouTube are proposing a separate digital debate, which they suggest could reach up to 55 million internet users.

"The East Midlands Trains service was travelling at 65mph (105 km/h) when it derailed at Barrow on Soar in Leicestershire in February 2008.
The train derailed after an engineering works tipper lorry hit a footbridge.
Leicester Crown Court heard the firm did not have a proper construction site safety assessment in place.
A train driver had to be cut free from his cab after the bridge collapsed in the accident, but no-one else was hurt.
A warning message had been sent out, but the Nottingham-to-Norwich passenger train was unable to stop in time.
The tipper truck driver did not realise the height of his truck and had left the back of it raised in the air, the court heard.
The train driver was trapped for two-and-a-half hours and suffered serious leg injuries.
""Network Rail's poor planning and management of construction site safety at Barrow placed members of the travelling public a risk,"" Darren Anderson of the Office of Rail Regulation said.

"Prof Higgs, who does not own a mobile phone, said a former neighbour had pulled up in her car as he was returning from lunch in Edinburgh.
He added: ""She congratulated me on the news and I said 'oh, what news?'""
The woman had been alerted by her daughter in London that Prof Higgs had won the award, he revealed.
He added: ""I heard more about it obviously when I got home and started reading the messages.""
The 84-year-old emeritus professor at the University of Edinburgh was recognised by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences for his work on the theory of the particle which shares his name, the Higgs boson.
He shares this year's physics prize with Francois Englert of Belgium, and joins the ranks of past Nobel winners including Marie Curie and Albert Einstein.
The existence of the so-called ""God particle"", said to give matter its substance, or mass, was proved almost 50 years later by a team from the European nuclear research facility (Cern) and its Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in Geneva, Switzerland.
Speaking for the first time about the award at a media conference at the University of Edinburgh, he said: ""How do I feel? Well, obviously I'm delighted and rather relieved in a sense that it's all over. It has been a long time coming.""
An old friend told him he had been nominated as far back as 1980, he said.
Prof Higgs added: ""In terms of later events, it seemed to me for many years that the experimental verification might not come in my lifetime.
""But since the start up of the LHC it has been pretty clear that they would get there, and despite some mishaps they did get there"".
Stressing the involvement of other theorists and Cern, he added: ""I think clearly they should, but it is going to be even more difficult for the Nobel Committee to allocate the credit when it comes to an organisation like Cern.
""I should remind you that although only two of us have shared this prize, Francois Englert of Brussels and myself, that the work in 1964 involved three groups of people, (including) two in Brussels.
""Unfortunately Robert Brout died a few years ago so is no longer able to be awarded the prize, but he would certainly have been one of the winners if he had still been alive.
""But there were three others who also contributed and it is already difficult to allocate the credit amongst the theorists.
""Although a lot of people seem to think I did all this single-handed, it was actually part of a theoretical programme which had been started in 1960.""
Prof Higgs was born in Newcastle, but developed his theory while working at the University of Edinburgh.
The landmark research that defined what was to become known as the Higgs boson was published in 1964.
Discovering the particle became one of the most sought-after goals in science, and the team of scientists behind the $10bn LHC at Cern made proving its existence a key priority.
In July of last year, physicists at Cern confirmed the discovery of a particle consistent with the Higgs boson.
Prof Higgs, who had often been uncomfortable with the attention his theory brought, was in Geneva to hear the news, and wiped a tear from his eye as the announcement was made.
Reacting to the discovery at the time, he told reporters: ""It's very nice to be right sometimes.""",Nobel Prize-winning scientist Prof Peter Higgs has revealed he did not know he had won the award until a woman congratulated him in the street.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The 31-year-old Australian was hurt during the Chiefs' narrow Champions Cup loss at Ulster and needs surgery.
Salvi joined the Chiefs in the summer of 2015 from Leicester and became a key part of the side that made last season's Premiership final.
""We're still waiting to learn the full extent of it but it looks relatively serious,"" head coach Rob Baxter said.
Salvi was twice short-listed for the Premiership's Player of the Year award while at Leicester and is a former Australia Under-21 captain.
""He does put in a huge contribution over 80 minutes, and that's probably what we'll miss the most,"" Baxter told BBC Sport.

"The papers were presented to a meeting of health board chief executives and civil servants last month.
They suggest the NHS is facing a £400m funding gap, and sweeping changes will be needed for boards to break even.
The Scottish government said it was committed to ""protecting and increasing the NHS budget"".
The papers were passed to the BBC and The Herald by a senior NHS whistleblower, who said they had become frustrated by the argument of the ""Yes"" campaign that the biggest threat to the NHS comes from the UK government.
The documents state: ""The status quo and preservation of existing models of care are no longer an option given the pressing challenges we face.""
The whistleblower has alleged that pressures on the NHS come from Scottish government policies.
The confidential documents relate to a meeting held by NHS bosses on 6 August 2014.
As part of an initiative to transform care by 2020, legislation has been passed by the Scottish government to encourage more community care.
However, the papers say this has been undermined by ""continued commitments"" which are ""directly in conflict"" with the 2020 vision and increase the cost of expensive hospital care.
The documents say new obligations are ""not fully funded"".  The documents conclude that the ""status quo in terms of service and workforce planning is not an option"".
The papers outline a funding gap of £400-£450m in the next two financial years, 2015-17, which is described as ""a level significantly in excess of that previously required"".
The documents suggest that health boards will have to consider centralising hospitals and closing services - a measure which the SNP vowed to stop when it was elected in 2007.
The Scottish government reversed the closure of Accident and Emergency departments at Monklands and Ayr hospitals, but the papers suggest such dramatic measures may be back on the table.
""Radical and urgent decisions need to be made regarding the shape and configuration of services,"" the document states.
But it also points out that boards are ""without the mandate and authority to implement the scale of change and redesign required"".
""We need to commit to these priorities and accept that significant changes require to be implemented,"" the papers conclude.
The whistleblower told the BBC: ""Services are unsustainable right across Scotland from three emergency centres in Lanarkshire, to emergency care at the Vale (of Leven) to paediatrics at St John's (in Livingston), and with particular issues for more rural boards, hence the problems at Grampian.
""The current pattern of services is underpinned but short-term money and fixes won't stack up going into next year.
""There is a complete gap between policy announcements about care in the community and more money for primary care, and the announcements and commitments which continually increase the cost of acute care.""
The Scottish government said the paper was ""part of the regular discussions among NHS leaders to plan for NHS Scotland's future"".
Health Secretary Alex Neil said: ""We've protected Scotland's NHS from the Tories' cuts, and with independence we can ensure that it is never again under threat from Westminster's dangerous obsession with austerity.
""Despite Scotland's budget being slashed by 7.2% by George Osborne between 2010/11 and 2015/16, our increases in health spending means that the NHS is receiving record high funding, with a budget increase of over £1bn between 2010/11 and 2015/16.""
He added: ""To ensure we can continue to develop the NHS, it's important that NHS boards regularly discuss their future plans to inform budget discussions with Scottish government officials, and to identify how we will continue to deliver quality care and treatment.
""We continue to develop our health service to meet the changing demands of the people of Scotland, and that's why we've already legislated to integrate health and social care from April next year.
""This integration of services is particularly important to ensure our elderly population is kept well and provided with care in the best setting for their wellbeing.""",Confidential papers passed to the BBC suggest a radical cost-saving plan will be implemented in the Scottish NHS after the referendum.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Lt Gen Zaid al-Saleh, head of the government's local security committee, said rebel fighters did not ""have much time"" and needed to ""surrender or die"".
Tens of thousands of civilians are also believed to be in the rebel enclave.
Syrian state TV showed footage of people in Aleppo celebrating, amid reports the army was close to victory.
The director of the UK-based monitoring group, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, warned of ""real massacres"" being carried out in Aleppo.
Rami Abdel Rahman called on the international community to find a safe haven for civilians.
Rebels have now lost more than 90% of the territory they once held in eastern Aleppo since government forces stepped up their offensive to regain full control of the city a month ago.
Russia, which backs the government, says more than 100,000 civilians have been displaced by the fighting and that 2,200 rebel fighters have surrendered.
Aleppo was once Syria's largest city, and its commercial and industrial hub before the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad began in 2011.
For much of the past four years it has been divided roughly in two, with the government controlling the western half and rebels the east.
Troops finally broke the deadlock with the help of Iranian-backed militias and Russian air strikes, reinstating a siege on the east in early September and launching an all-out assault weeks later.
On Monday morning, the official Sana news agency cited a military source as saying that the army had taken full control of the key southern district of Sheikh Saeed, as well as the neighbouring areas of Karam al-Daadaa and Saliheen.
Hours later, nearby Bustan al-Qasr, Kallasa, Fardous, Jaloun and Jisr al-Haj had also fallen after rebel fighters withdrew in the face of an intense government bombardment, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported.
Late on Monday the monitoring group said that clashes were continuing in Salah al-Din neighbourhood and other areas remaining under rebel control.
In an interview with the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme, an English teacher who is still inside a rebel-held area described the conditions as terrible.
""The situation inside the eastern part of Aleppo is literally doomsday,"" Abdul Kafi Alhamado said. ""Bombs are everywhere, people are running, people are injured in the streets, no-one can dare go to help them, some people are under the rubble.""
The Syrian Observatory says that at least 415 civilians and 364 rebel fighters have been killed in rebel-held areas since 15 November. Another 130 civilians have died in rebel rocket and mortar attacks on the government-controlled west.
Russia and the United States, which backs the rebels, held talks in Geneva over the weekend to discuss a deal for civilians and rebel fighters to leave Aleppo.
But on Monday, US officials said their Russian counterparts had rejected a proposal for an immediate cessation of hostilities to allow for safe departures.
Analysts say the fall of Aleppo would be a big blow to the opposition, as it would leave the government in control of Syria's four largest cities.
However, the head of the umbrella group that represented political and armed opposition factions at failed peace talks at the start of this year insisted that their determination to overthrow the president would not be diminished.
""If Assad and his allies think that a military advance in certain quarters of Aleppo will signify that we will make concessions, then [I say] that will not happen,"" Riyad Hijab, general co-ordinator of the High Negotiations Committee, told reporters.
As fighting intensified for the last rebel-held neighbourhoods, there have been frantic efforts to secure guarantees to evacuate the most vulnerable - the very ill, gravely injured and innocent children. All efforts have been in vain.
""It's a far dream,"" one frustrated aid official told me on Monday, about a long-standing request for a UN-organised medical mission for about 500 patients and their families.
Two efforts, which seemed close to agreement, collapsed last week when Russia asserted there was no need for a ceasefire since tens of thousands were escaping without one.  Sources say Russia then shifted its stance. But rebel groups demanded a ceasefire and a delivery of aid first.
In desperation, aid agencies reduced their request from 72 hours to just three. A group known as ""Doctors Under Fire"" has also been pleading for the evacuation of hundreds of children.
British surgeon Dr David Nott says ""we only need a temporary cessation of 60 minutes to save them all.""

"The federation represents thousands of rank and file PSNI officers.
Its chairman, Mark Lindsay, has said confidence in the office of the ombudsman is at an all-time low.
A spokesperson for the ombudsman said the comments were ""disappointing"" and ""at odds with the feedback from police officers who had been investigated"".
Mr Lindsay told the federation's annual conference that ""reform is not so much desirable as essential"".
He also said the PSNI is in a state of crisis because of reducing budgets and officer numbers.
Criticism of the office of the ombudsman by the federation is not new.
In his speech on Wednesday, Mr Lindsay said the federation accepted the need for the independent investigation of complaints against police officers.
But, with Ombudsman Dr Michael Maguire among the audience at the La Mon House Hotel, he suggested some feel they are victims of a ""witch hunt"".
""It gives me no pleasure to say that, unfortunately, there is very little officer confidence in relation to the operation of the ombudsman's office,"" he said.
""The credibility of the office is also seriously questioned.""
The federation chairman highlighted the ongoing PSNI investigation into the theft and unlawful disclosure of documents from the ombudsman's office.
He also cited the discovery of a gun and ammunition in a filing cabinet belonging to a member of staff in the office last year.
""There is an obvious need for an independent avenue of appeal, whereby officers will have meaningful redress against malicious and inept investigations,"" he said.
""The ombudsman is with us today and I say to him that this isn't about you, but rather the legislative architecture of the system you preside over.
""If your office conducts itself with the high standards you demand of police officers, then surely you have nothing to fear from such accountability.""
Mr Lindsay said the level of assaults against police officers by members of the public is ""unacceptably high"" and called for tougher action to protect them.
He told the conference that eight out of 10 PSNI officers who responded to a survey said they had been victims of a physical or verbal assault during the past year.

"Rocky Taylor, a friend of 40 years standing, said the former BBC radio DJ and Crackerjack presenter had died in hospital in Bournemouth.
Stewart's former brother-in-law, Adriano Henney, tweeted to say ""Fun guy-Huge loss"".
Director of BBC Music Bob Shennan said Stewart had been a ""stalwart"" of popular music broadcasting.
Mr Shennan said Stewart's shows had been enjoyed by millions of listeners.
Ed 'Stewpot' Stewart: Your memories
Stewart's BBC Radio 2 colleagues were extremely saddened, he said, adding: ""We are thinking of Ed's friends and family at this difficult time.""
Stewart's fellow DJ from his early days on pirate radio, Tony Blackburn, who also went on to Radio 1, said Stewart would be missed.
""A lovely guy, loved his golf and he loved playing the songs on Junior Choice.
""I think he'll probably be best remembered for Junior Choice because he did that programme, I think, particularly well.
""He was very, very good at that, and of course, on television.""
His former colleague and friend of 50 years, BBC DJ David Hamilton, said Stewart ""was a little bit like a good wine; he just got better as time went on"".
The DJ, also known by the nickname ""Diddy"", said he spoke to his old friend just a few days ago.
He said: ""We used to play football together in the showbiz football team, we even once rode in a speedway race together at Wembley Stadium, so we've done a lot of things together.
""He was a really good guy, Ed, and I really will miss him.""
His younger sister, Sue Mainwaring, 69, described him as hardworking, loyal and ""such a good brother"".
""We had such fun. When he was on the pirates [radio stations] he had two weeks on and one week off - of which every weekend he'd invite everybody back for jazz sessions. Celebs used to come along, including Kenny Everett, David Hamilton, Tony Brandon. He loved jazz. He loved music.""
She said she had spent Christmas and New Year with him and other members of the family.
Devon-born Stewart's broadcasting career spanned more than 50 years. He started out as an announcer, film critic and rugby reporter with Radio Hong Kong.
In an interview with the Express newspaper in 2014, he said he had returned to England five years later and joined pirate radio ship Radio London, based four miles off shore.
He was one of the first presenters on Radio 1 when it launched in 1967, and went on to become a regular Top of the Pops presenter in the 1970s.
He was a regular Radio 2 presenter for 15 years, and during that time broadcast from the summits of Ben Nevis and Snowdon, Mount Vesuvius volcano in Italy, and also live from the Falkland Islands.
On television, Stewart was best known for children's favourite Crackerjack. He hosted the show from 1973 to 1979.
He was also a longstanding presenter of children's show Junior Choice, which last broadcast on BBC Radio 2 over Christmas.
On it he coined his trademark catchphrase: '''Ello darling.""
In his sign-off at the end of his final programme, he thanked listeners, saying: ""I'll be with you whenever, but have a great Christmas Day, won't you, folks?""
Off air, he was a keen golfer and dedicated Everton FC fan.
On Twitter, TV presenter Noel Edmonds left heartfelt messages about the man he called his ""mentor"".
Edmonds joined BBC Radio 1 in 1969, taking over from the sacked Kenny Everett in 1970. At 21, he was the station's youngest DJ at the time.
""In '67 Ed Stewart heard a DJ audition tape, liked it, passed it to Kenny Everett and my career was born. Stewpot I owe you everything xN,"" he tweeted.
Former Radio 1 DJ and current Radio 2 broadcaster Simon Mayo wrote in a tweet: ""How sad to hear of the passing of Ed Stewart.  Junior Choice was always a radio classic"".
Celebrity astrologer Russell Grant tweeted: ""So sad to hear an old DJ colleague of mine Ed Stewart 'Stewpot' has passed over.
""I last worked with him on Radio Mercury. Happy memories.""
Coronation Street actor Les Dennis posted: ""Sad to hear Ed ""Stewpot"" Stewart has died. A great broadcaster and a nice man.""
Stewart is survived by his two children, Francesca and Marco, and four grandchildren.","Former BBC DJ Ed ""Stewpot"" Stewart has died at the age of 74, a few days after having a stroke, friends have said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The phrase ""rapid rise through the ranks"" is a standard line in profiles of political leaders. But it's rarely as speedy as in Natalie Bennett's case.
The Australian-born former Guardian journalist woke up on New Year's Day 2006 and decided she wanted to do something to change the world.
After pondering her options (should she get involved with an NGO or the UN?) she joined the Green Party. Within six short years she had become its leader.
Three years after that she was sharing a stage with the prime minister and other party leaders in a televised general election debate.
Her sudden arrival on the frontline of British politics was all the more remarkable because she had never won an election, other than the one that had made her party leader.
Her first aim when she took on the job was to insert the Green Party - routinely ignored or patronised by the mainstream media - into the national conversation.
But when media outlets finally began calling, on the back of a surge in support for the party, she sometimes found it difficult to get her message across in a suitably snappy way.
Her vision for the party was to show how ""economic and environmental justice are indivisible"", she explains, ""the idea that tackling environmental problems isn't an add-on luxury"".
It was ""not a easy concept to get across"", she confesses. ""I still don't think I've got the 12 second soundbite. But I am going to keep working on it.""
""It's a classic Shakespearean thing,"" she says of her struggles with the broadcast media. ""It's both my strength and my weakness that I answer the question.""
But, she adds, ""when you get asked a stupid question, it's rather hard to know what to do at that point. And I guess I get tangled up in my desire to answer a question, even when it's a really stupid question"".
Did she get asked a lot of stupid questions?
""Yes.""
Asked for an example, she ponders for a minute, before highlighting an interview with the BBC's very own John Humphrys, which led to her having ""to spend time, valuable peak time, explaining how the interviewer got the question wrong. And listeners don't particularly like that because it's all technical and boring and you are arguing with the interviewer but if it's entirely on the wrong track you have to"".
She says she has some sympathy with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who has also attracted criticism for broadcast interviews in which he has deviated from the usual prepared soundbites.
""The focus on the individual is a problem for British politics and it's very uncomfortable when the focus is on you,"" she says, arguing that the media in continental Europe are focused more on policies than personalities and trivia.
""I am not complaining - you have to work within those limits,"" she adds, but she believes British politics is ""broken"" and the media must take its share of the blame.
""There should be some pressure on the journalist to ask better, more sensible questions,"" she argues.
There was nothing particularly stupid about the question that prompted her darkest moment in a radio studio, however, when she struggled over several excruciating minutes, punctuated by coughing fits, to answer a question from LBC's Nick Ferrari on her party's housing policy.
She was quick to hold her hands up afterwards, apologising to supporters and blaming her sub-par performance, in the heat of the general election campaign, on ""brain freeze"".
""That was a very tough moment. And of course you take a bit of a punch to the stomach.
""But then a few weeks later I was up on the leader debates, able to look David Cameron in the eye and challenge him about his failure to welcome Syrian refugees to Britain, and that was one of the best moments.
""My great problem on that day was that I was in no way well enough to actually be doing anything. I'd had about three and a half hours sleep and I'd been throwing up most of the night. I should have just pulled the day but that's partly a function of how we got to that point.
""We weren't used to getting a lot of media attention and it was very, very hard to turn media attention down.""
One of Ms Bennett's proudest moments came at the end of the BBC leaders debate when she joined Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood and Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon in a ""group hug"", while Labour leader Ed Miliband looked on awkwardly.
This felt like a watershed moment for women in politics, she says, sending out the message ""that politics can not just be 'dog eat dog', it can be people agreeing on some things and disagreeing on others but supporting each other"".
As a lifelong feminist, she is particularly pleased to have been told by ""lots of young women"" that they had been inspired by the ""group hug"", which she stresses had not been planned in advance.
""I hope and think that that moment really, in 15 years' time, 20 years' time, we might see a whole crop of MPs down the road who will reference that moment as the time they decided they were going to try and get there.""
Ms Bennett's decision to pitch for the anti-austerity vote, positioning the Greens as a left-wing alternative to what was then Ed Miliband's Labour Party, struck a chord with idealistic young people who felt alienated by mainstream politics, and led to a surge in party membership.
But then Jeremy Corbyn came along and shifted Labour firmly to the left, inspiring idealistic activists to join his party in numbers the Greens could only dream about.
Hasn't the Green Party, which had a mixed set of results in May's elections, losing four councillors in England and failing to make progress in Wales but getting its best ever result in London, been crowded out of the picture by Labour?
Ms Bennett insists this is not the case, arguing that there is a ""very clear distinction"" between the Greens and Labour on a range of issues - from nuclear weapons to fracking - and that voters know exactly what they are getting when they vote Green.
But she is also open to the idea of a ""progressive alliance"" at the next general election, with local Green Parties potentially making electoral pacts with Labour, Plaid Cymru, the SNP or other parties who broadly share their outlook.
She remains a passionate advocate of electoral reform. The Green Party fielded a record number of general election candidates in 2015, standing in 93% of constituencies, and gaining more than a million votes. By rights, she argues, the party should have 25 MPs. She believes the case for scrapping what she sees as Britain's outdated first-past-the-post electoral system is gaining ground in the country.
She says she has had an ""amazing"" four years as leader, and has no regrets, believing the party is in better shape now, having quadrupled its membership and gained a foothold in the national debate on issues such as welfare and the economy, than when she took over.
But she is also keen to stress that she will not be leaving politics.
""I'm aiming to turn former leader into a role in its own right, to keep travelling the country, supporting local parties, doing media. Leadership is a role we can share around. It's not you become leader, that's the pinnacle, and then you disappear.""
Asked if she has any advice for the next leader, she says trust the party membership.
Anything else?
""Work out how to answer stupid questions,"" she laughs. ""I still don't quite know the answer to that one myself.""","As the Green Party of England and Wales prepares to unveil a replacement for Natalie Bennett, who is standing down after four years as leader, she reflects on life in the media spotlight - and what she plans to do next.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Ashford Borough Council is owed more than £70,000 and Canterbury City Council is owed almost £45,000 in unpaid fines, BBC South East has found.
More than half of Kent's councils are using a private company to help recover fines issued to foreign drivers.
In Brighton more than three-quarters of fines were unpaid, a Freedom of Information request has found.
Brighton and Hove City Council told BBC South East it had issued 5,402 fines to foreign drivers, with 1,216 paid, and 3,400 remaining unpaid.  The council said it had written off the remaining 746 fines.
Most of those drivers fined in Kent were in tourist destinations in East Kent and near the Channel ports.
A private company called Euro Parking Collection has been hired by eight councils in Kent to work with Vehicle Licensing Authorities to collect some of the outstanding fines.
Illegal parking in the UK is a civil offence so councils cannot request drivers' names and addresses from their home countries.
In France and some other European countries however, illegal parking is a criminal offence dealt with by the police.
Patrick Troy from the British Parking Association said: ""Local authorities don't have the means by which to enforce fines against foreign registered vehicles in the same way the do against UK registered vehicles.
""There is discrimination here and we've been arguing for some time that the government should work with colleagues in the European Union to negotiate reciprocal arrangements.""",Foreign drivers owe south-east councils tens of thousands of pounds in unpaid parking fines issued in 2014-15.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Chris Coleman's team are likely to face a tough draw as they will be one of the lowest-seeded teams.
But former striker Rush believes the biggest nations will not want to face a Welsh side which lost only once in qualifying.
""They won't want Wales in their group,"" Rush told BBC Wales' Sport Wales.
""I'm not saying we are going to win it but the opposition won't like to play Wales.
""Every game will be a big test and they will learn from it and I think we will win a game.""
Rush is the country's all-time leading goalscorer with 28 goals, while Gareth Bale took his tally to 19 with Wales' second goal in the 2-0 win over Andorra.
Real Madrid forward Bale scored seven of Wales' 11 goals in Euro 2016 qualifying, with Aaron Ramsey netting twice and Hal Robson-Kanu and David Cotterill scoring one apiece.
But former Liverpool and Juventus striker Rush is not too concerned by Wales' limited forward options.
""The lads that play there I think you forget the work that they do. They put in a tremendous work rate,"" Rush added.
""What we may be missing is someone to tap the ball in
""But Robson-Kanu, [Sam] Vokes and [Simon] Church give it 110% so you can't knock that. I think sometimes you need that goal to give you confidence.

"The union wants to take over Newport Gwent Dragons and the ground, hoping to solve the water-logging problems by laying a 4G surface.
But  if County stay up Football League rules do not allow artificial surfaces.
""Ideally we would have wanted to put an artificial pitch down,"" said WRU chief executive, Martyn Phillips.
""We want the ground to be a hub for rugby for women and girls and kids and get it played on all day, every day.
""That is probably not going to be possible now because Newport County need a grass pitch.
""So we are in a dialogue with them now about how, over the summer, we put it back to what a pro club should have.""
County, under boss Mike Flynn, are looking to pull of what would be  a miraculous relegation escape against Notts County, having been 11 points from safety as recently as March.
Following financial difficulties at the Dragons, the WRU has offered a deal to take over the region and a vote is set to be held by shareholders of Newport RFC who own Rodney Parade.
The rugby club, Dragons and County share the pitch which has major drainage problems that have forced postponements and abandonments this season.
County have an agreement to play at Rodney Parade until 2023 and Phillips said it would be honoured.
However, relegation would raise the prospect of a 4G pitch being laid as such surfaces are allowed in  the National League
Phillips added: ""Newport County have a licence there and, despite what anyone might think, we are not in the business of wanting Newport not to be a pro club.
""We are like everyone else in that we hope they get the win and carry on.
""But the flipside of that is that the pitch is no good for us and no good for them.""",The Welsh Rugby Union will halt plans for an artificial pitch at Rodney Parade if Newport County stay in the Football League.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"The Mi-8 transporter was brought down by rebels, Russia says, in northern Idlib province.
It was returning from delivering humanitarian aid to the besieged city of Aleppo, the defence ministry said.
It is not clear which group brought the helicopter down.
An alliance of forces, including hardline jihadist factions, is the dominant power in Idlib.
Jabhat Fateh al-Sham - formerly known as Jabhat al-Nusra - is among those active in the province, and so-called Islamic State has vowed to carry out jihad against Russian forces.
The helicopter was carrying three crew and two officers.
Pictures on social media, purportedly of the latest Russian helicopter downing, showed burning wreckage and bodies, with armed men milling around.
Footage showed at least one body being dragged away. Another is seen apparently being trampled on.
This is the worst single loss of life for Russia since it launched its air offensive in Syria in support of President Assad towards the end of last year.
Moscow says the helicopter was not involved in a military mission, but was delivering humanitarian aid.  Rebel sources appear to confirm this.  It may not have been known to those who shot the helicopter down, as most of Russia's airpower in Syria has been used for military purposes to support pro-government forces.
But it will further inflame feelings in Russia against rebels in Syria.  Moscow has repeatedly said it sees little distinction between the rebels in terms of brutality and extremism.  The graphic images of victims posted online of the aftermath of the incident will add fuel to the fire.
Russia has previously, though seldom, lost aircraft since it launched operations in support of the Syrian government at the end of September 2015.
In July, two Russian pilots were killed when their helicopter was shot down east of the city of Palmyra by so-called Islamic State (IS).
Last November, the pilot of a Russian Su-24 fighter plane was killed when the aircraft was shot down by Turkey on its border with Syria.
A Russian marine sent on a mission to rescue the pilot was also killed when his helicopter was shot down.
Russia is a key backer of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and is supporting pro-government forces with air strikes on rebels.
Government forces cut off rebel-held eastern parts of Aleppo last month.
Russia and Syria announced the opening of what they called humanitarian corridors for civilians and rebels wanting to surrender, but few people are reported to have used them, fearing they would be targeted.

Opposition activists have dismissed as a lie Russian claims that 160 civilians had left rebel-held districts.

"The clip, said to have been filmed in the city of Mosul, in northern Iraq, is the first footage of John Cantlie to emerge in more than a year.
In the footage, Mr Cantlie ridicules US attempts to destroy IS.
The Foreign Office said it was ""looking at the contents of this latest propaganda video"".
Mr Cantlie was last seen in a similar video in Syria in February 2015.
Like the latest film, it also had him addressing the camera as if he was presenting a television report.
Mr Cantlie, who is originally from Hampshire, has seen his work appear in the Sunday Times, the Sun and the Sunday Telegraph.
He has been held captive in Syria twice. After being kidnapped in July 2012, he escaped with help from the Free Syrian Army.
He was then kidnapped for a second time when he returned to the country towards the end of 2012. It is believed he was with US journalist James Foley, who was later killed.

"The Australian Livestock Exporters' Council said the footage, released by animal rights group Animals Australia, was ""horrific"".
Animals Australia said it had been filmed inside the two abattoirs approved to process Australian cattle.
Exports to Egypt were halted in 2006 for four years over similar concerns.
And in 2011, livestock exports to Indonesia were suspended after evidence of cruelty emerged there.
The Egyptian videos have not been made public, but Animals Australia said they showed cattle believed to have come from Australia being treated in a ""vicious, cruel and clumsy"" way.
The group is campaigning for a full ban on livestock exports.
""The way that these animals are treated are quite horrific,"" said spokeswoman Glenys Oogjes.
In one instance, a cow fell off the processing line and was chased through the abattoir before having its legs cut and being stabbed to death, she said.
""It is quite terrible and it shows systemic problems in these abattoirs for our animals. And how Australia ever sent animals back there after a suspension in 2006 is beyond us.""
The chief executive of the Livestock Exporters' Council, Alison Penfold, said the acts shown in the footage were ""exceptionally distressing"" and ""completely unacceptable to the industry and to Australians"".
She told the BBC the trade was undertaken under a memorandum of understanding between the Australian and the Egyptian governments.
The industry was investigating, she said, and working with the Egyptian authorities to ensure the welfare of animals already at the facilities.
Australia's Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry said in a statement it was ""pleased with the level of co-operation"" from the Egyptian authorities.
Australia exports more than 700,000 cattle each year, and the industry is worth about A$1bn ($1.03bn: Â£0.7bn) a year.
But pressure is growing for a total ban on live exports amid a series of cruelty scandals.
Agriculture Minister Joe Ludwig said he backed the industry's voluntary suspension.
He said the export industry had ""bright future"" but that it had to ""maintain animal welfare outcomes"", The Australian newspaper reports.",Australia is suspending the export of live cattle to Egypt after video emerged showing extreme cruelty to animals in Egyptian abattoirs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

""That's the togetherness we have in this team,"" he told BBC Sport.
""We have the ingredients there to go on from this. We have the foundations in place to go and achieve more.""

Even in a sport that is full of ups and downs in so many contests, it is an impressive statistic that Saturday's final was the 14th time that Hull have come from behind to win this season.

"In-form striker James Vaughan gave the hosts a 22nd-minute lead before Reece Brown scored a 45th-minute free-kick from around 40 yards.
Bury were stunned by three goals in eight minutes through Erhun Oztumer and a Jason McCarthy brace, but Tom Soares pounced at the death to deny Walsall a third straight win.
Tom Pope and Amadou Bakayoko had gone close at each end before Pope crossed for Vaughan to slide in his 17th goal of the season - and seventh in three games.
Neil Etheridge then saved a Pope header and blocked the striker's follow-up, while Bury's Rob Lainton saved a Bakayoko shot.
But Bury doubled their lead as Brown's free-kick caught Etheridge off his line and flew into the top corner.
The Shakers eased off in the second half, though, and Walsall made them pay. Matt Preston had a shot blocked on the line and Lainton denied Isaiah Osbourne from the rebound.
But Oztumer hit a 20-yard free-kick into the bottom corner on 71 minutes to spark the Saddlers' fightback.
Five minutes later, McCarthy fired home from Bakayoko's cut-back before the Southampton loanee headed home from Osbourne's cross.

"Some 60 excavators and 100 dump trucks are being used in the search. The boy fell down the 40m dry well in Baoding, Hebei province on Sunday morning.
He had been helping harvest vegetables, his father told Chinese media. The child's condition is unknown.
Oxygen, food and water have been supplied. The 30cm-diameter well is too narrow for an adult to retrieve him.
After two days of careful digging, rescuers have dug only 13m down the metal shaft, which threatens to collapse at any moment.
An 800-square metre work area has been cleared to facilitate rescue attempts, a volunteer told The Paper, a Shanghai-based news website.
The well had been left unused for five years and there were no warning signs. Visual imagery has so far failed to locate the boy.
Many locals volunteered to help in the rescue, rushing to the scene after learning about the accident on WeChat, a popular communication app in China.
Most netizens sent good wishes to the boy.
""It was saddening to read about such news. As a mother, it was heartbreaking to see a child fall into a well. I hope the child will be alive and alive,"" one user called 80 Hou Bu Huai wrote.

"A rugged, mountainous country, with lush valleys to the south and north, it is Central Asia's poorest nation.
Tajiks are the country's largest ethnic group, with Uzbeks making up a quarter of the population, over half of which is employed in agriculture and just one-fifth in industry. A third of Tajikistan's population is under 14 years of age.

The five-year civil war between the Moscow-backed government and the Islamist-led opposition, in which up to 50,000 people were killed and over one-tenth of the population fled the country, ended in 1997 with a United Nations-brokered peace agreement.
Tajikistan's economy has never really recovered from the civil war, and poverty is widespread. Almost half of GDP is earned by migrants working abroad, especially in Russia, but the recession in 2009 threatened that income. The country is also dependent on oil and gas imports.
Economic hardship is seen as a contributing to a renewed interest in Islam - including more radical forms - among young Tajiks.
Tajikistan has been accused by its neighbours of tolerating the presence of training camps for Islamist rebels on its territory, an accusation which it has strongly denied.
Tajikistan has relied heavily on Russian assistance to counter continuing security problems and cope with the dire economic situation. Skirmishes with drug smugglers crossing illegally from Afghanistan occur regularly, as Tajikistan is the first stop on the drugs route from there to Russia and the West.
Russia maintains military garrisons in Tajikistan and in 2004 took back control over a former Soviet space monitoring centre. These developments were widely seen as a sign of Russia's wish to counter increased US influence in Central Asia.
Economic ties with neighbouring China are extensive. China has extended credits and has helped to build roads, tunnels and power infrastructure. Chinese firms are investing in oil and gas exploration and in gold mining.","A former Soviet republic, Tajikistan plunged into civil war almost as soon as it became independent from the Soviet Union in 1991.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"She was 12 at the time and living with her parents and two siblings in northern Peru.
On that night, two officials came to their home and took away her father.
Mr Katsura, who owned a small general store, was arrested because he was part of Peru's prosperous Japanese community.
""My father told them he hadn't done anything wrong, but they didn't listen to him,"" she recalls.
Japanese people began migrating to Peru in considerable numbers at the end of the 19th Century, drawn by opportunities to work in the mines and on sugar plantations.
By the 1940s, an estimated 25,000 people of Japanese descent lived in Peru. Many had become lawyers and doctors, or owned small businesses.
Their prosperity, further fuelled by racism, soon triggered anti-Japanese sentiment in Peru, Stephanie Moore explains.
Ms Moore, a scholar at the Japanese Peruvian Oral History Project, says after the outbreak of World War Two, the Japanese community in Peru became a target, and their assets were confiscated.
""In May 1940, as many as 600 houses, schools and businesses belonging to citizens of Japanese descent were burned down,"" she says.
Following Japan's 1941 attack on the US naval base at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii, the US government asked a dozen Latin American countries, among them Peru, to arrest its Japanese residents.
Records from the time suggest the US authorities wanted to take them to the US and use them as bargaining chips for its nationals captured by Japanese forces in Asia.
Mr Katsura was among the 2,200 Latin Americans of Japanese descent who were forcibly deported to internment camps in the US.
Blanca Katsura, who is now 83 and lives in Northern California, remembers how she learned of his fate.
""A month after my father was detained, he sent me a letter because it was my birthday,"" she recalls.
""He had been taken to Panama from where they were planning to send him to the US,"" she adds.
Six months later, Blanca Katsura's mother decided to take her three small children to the US to search for her husband.
""When we arrived in New Orleans after a month-long trip, they confiscated our passports and then sent us by train to the Crystal City camp.""
As many as 4,000 people were interned during World War Two in this camp in Texas run by the US Immigration and Naturalization Service.
Most of the detainees were of Japanese descent, although some German and Italian immigrants were also held there.
It was at Crystal City that Blanca Katsura was reunited with her father. ""I was shocked, he had lost so much weight,"" she remembers.
For the next four years, her family lived in the barracks at the camp.
Her memories of that time are not particularly traumatic, she says.
""Being a child at the time time, I had no worries and made lots of friends.
""We were able to go to school and learn Japanese,"" she adds.
Ms Katsura says she later learned that the camp authorities were keen for the children to learn Japanese so they would be able to speak the language once they were deported to Japan.
Chieko Kamisato's memories of life at Crystal City are less positive.
""You could call it a concentration camp, because we were surrounded by barbed wire fences and guards with guns,"" she says.
""We couldn't go out at all, although we were free to move around inside,"" she recalls.
""My parents were really bitter about the situation because they were forced to come to the US. They had no choice,"" she says.
Ms Kamisato's father had moved to Peru from Japan in 1915 and had worked hard to open a bakery in the capital, Lima.
Now 81, she lives in Los Angeles.
Of the 2,200 Latin Americans of Japanese descent to be interned in the US, 800 were sent to Japan as part of prisoner exchanges.
After World War Two ended, another 1,000 were deported to Japan after their Latin American home countries refused to take them back.
Ms Katsura's and Ms Kamisato's families successfully fought deportation and were eventually allowed to remain in the US.
In 1988, then-President Ronald Reagan signed the Civil Liberties Act and apologised on behalf of the US government for the internment of Japanese-Americans.
Under the act, the government paid tens of thousands of survivors of the camps $20,000 (Â£13,000) each in reparation.
But Japanese-Latin Americans did not qualify for the payments because they had not been US citizens or permanent residents of the US at the time of their internment.
Outraged, they filed a class-action suit and 10 years later, the US government agreed to pay them $5,000 each.
Most accepted, but a small group headed by camp survivor Art Shibayama decided to hold out, demanding to be paid the same as Japanese-Americans.
Blanca Katsura says that even though her childhood at the camp may not have been traumatic, no amount of money can compensate her family for its loss.
""My parents wanted to go back to Peru but couldn't. They missed the life they had there,"" she recalls.
""The Peruvian government sold us out to the US government and that is not a very nice feeling. How would you feel about it?""",Blanca Katsura will never forget the night of 6 January 1943.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"John Griffith-Jones was asked at a Treasury Select Committee hearing whether the Treasury had leant on the FCA or undermined its independence.
He said that the ""simple answer"" was ""no to both"".
Acting chief executive Tracey McDermott said the suggestion was ""nonsense"".
Two senior FCA figures were speaking at a committee hearing called after it emerged that the inquiry, described as a ""thematic review"", had been scrapped.
The FCA had planned to look at whether pay, promotion or other incentives had contributed to scandals involving banks in the UK and abroad.
Ms McDermott told the committee the review had been shelved because ""we didn't think that we would be able to put out something that was sufficiently useful or valuable to make it worthwhile spending resources and time on doing it"".
She said the review would have duplicated other work carried out elsewhere, notably by the Banking Standards Board, which was ""looking at precisely the same issue"".
She said the FCA was now seeking to ""build on work done by other bodies"" and would be focusing on individual firms through regulatory supervision.
Banks around the world have faced huge fines from regulators for their involvement in numerous scandals.
In May last year, the news agency Reuters calculated that 20 global banks had paid Â£152bn in fines and compensation to customers since the 2008 financial crisis.","The chairman of the City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), has said political considerations played no part in its decision to shelve an inquiry into the culture of banking.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Their rise to third place in the polls comes despite a string of pre-election scandals.
One local candidate stood down after a picture emerged of her wearing a swastika armband.
Another was highlighted for posting racist and anti-immigrant comments online.
And yet, the revelations appear to have had little obvious effect on voters, even if the mainstream parties do not want anything to do with the party.
They are led by the dapper and clean-cut Jimmie Akesson, 35.
Voters also seemed unperturbed by the news that he has gambled half a million kronor (Â£43,000; 54,000 euros; $70,000) online.
""Every crisis the party gets into Mr Akesson handles very efficiently,"" says Ulf Bjereld, professor of political science at the University of Gothenburg, who sees him as a very skilful politician, if uncharismatic.
Any political party would struggle to fend off accusations of racism, he told the BBC, but the party leader simply took them off the list and said they were not welcome.
They will now occupy 49 seats in Sweden's 349-seat parliament.
By publicly stressing the Sweden Democrats' zero tolerance towards racism for the past two years, he has been careful not to fall out of step with the tolerance that Swedes believe they have towards ethnic minorities.
In contrast with other EU countries, Sweden is granting automatic residence to all refugees fleeing the Syrian conflict and some 80,000 people are expected to apply for asylum this year.
The Sweden Democrats have carefully refined their 2010 election platform, when their campaign commercial featured an elderly woman pushing slowly towards a welfare desk.
""You can choose if you want to save money from the pensions or immigration budgets,"" ran the commentary, over menacing music.
The pensioner is overtaken by a group of women in burqas.
The party made it into parliament in 2010 with 5.7% of the vote, five years after Jimmie Akesson took on the leadership.
Beforehand the party had been linked for years to neo-Nazis and other extremist groups.
In a speech in August, he identified himself as a nationalist but called for his party to show they were ""broad and inclusive"".
But he was forthright on the risks of political Islam.
""Islamism is the Nazism and communism of our time. It has to be met with disgust and much stronger resistance than has so far been the case.""
The anti-immigration rhetoric has been toned down and carefully argued, with a policy of preferring to help refugees in their own countries.
There are obvious parallels with France's National Front which, under the leadership of Marine Le Pen, has moved into the political mainstream.
The two parties go back many years, and Ms Le Pen visited Jimmie Akesson last year in Stockholm. A few months ago he praised the National Front's ""modern, quite fresh direction"".
That does not mean the Sweden Democrats have shaken off their past but, with two MEPs in the European Parliament, they are now part of the same grouping as the Eurosceptic UK Independence Party - the Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy group.
Swedish voters are attracted to the party, more because it gives a voice to people who dislike the political elite than its stance on immigration, Prof Bjereld believes.
And although he argues that party membership will always have a racist element, the main stance is more xenophobic than racist.
""One of Jimmie Akesson's skills is that he sends one message to the racists in his party and another to the general public.""","They see themselves as the kingmakers of Swedish politics and, after polling 13% in national elections, the far-right Sweden Democrats are now difficult for mainstream parties to ignore.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Hills Quarry Products has submitted a planning application to the county council for a sand and gravel quarry near the village of Clifton Hampden.
It said the development, known as Fullamoor Quarry, will see 2.5m tonnes of earth extracted over 10 years.
But residents said the plan poses a threat ""to the health and wellbeing"" of their communities.
Chairman of campaign group Bachport (Burcot and Clifton Hampden Protection of the River Thames) Ian Mason said: ""It's vital that people express their deep concerns.
""A quarry would devastate a tranquil part of the Oxford Green Belt bordering the Thames and we fear more flooding as the proposed site is in the flood plain.""
He added that the biggest concern was the traffic a quarry would generate, with 570 lorry movements a week.
Hills Quarry Products director Peter Andrew said the application followed an 18-month public consultation, which included meetings with residents.
He said: ""As a result of the feedback received, we significantly reduced our plans in relation to the volumes of material we hope to extract and the time we will take to work the site.
""The final restoration plans were also scaled back so that no additional material is brought on to site, which in turn reduced the overall number of vehicle movements.""
In a statement the company said the proposed quarry covers an area of 104 hectares, of which 76 hectares will be worked.

"Police said Alexandria Hollinghurst, 17, and Brandon Goode, 18, wrote what appeared to be suicide notes.
The notes were recovered before the pair were found dead in undergrowth on Saturday.

Her family had emigrated to the US six years ago.
Orange County Sheriff's Office said the couple had been reported as ""missing endangered due to the suicidal notes"" in the hours before the shooting.
A police spokesman said: ""Goode and Hollinghurst are now officially considered suspects in the homicide of Officer Robert German.
""While Goode and Hollinghurst died of what is believed to be gunshot wounds from apparent suicide, we are awaiting the medical examiner's findings for the exact cause of death.""
The shootings took place in the early hours of Saturday in the suburb of Windermere, Orlando.
The sheriff's office said Windermere Police Department Officer German had reported stopping ""two individuals"" on foot at 03:57 local time, and had then radioed for backup.
When colleagues arrived they discovered Officer German ""mortally wounded"" with a gunshot injury and he was later pronounced dead at Orlando Regional Medical Centre.
At the same time, gunshots were heard nearby and the bodies of Miss Hollinghurst and Mr Goode were discovered a short distance away, police said.
Miss Hollinghurst and her family previously lived in the Derbyshire village of Hadfield.
Tony McMylor, who lived next door to the family in Hadfield, believes Miss Hollinghurst was murdered.
""He shot her and then shot himself. That's what I believe,"" he said.

Police said the contents of the apparent suicide notes ""will not be revealed at this time as the investigation is active and open"".

"The Coseley School in Dudley has 557 pupils - just over half its 975 capacity - and last year's GCSE results placed it bottom in the borough.
About 100 people protested outside Dudley Council house on Monday as the decision was made to put the closure plan to the public.
The consultation will run until 5 April, with a decision due in May.
'Safe haven'
If the plan goes ahead, years seven, eight and nine will go to different schools next year.
Current year 10's would stay and complete their GCSE's with the school shutting altogether in August 2017.
Head girl Tatiana Davies protested with fellow pupils against the closure.
She said: ""This place is like a safe haven for kids and it's a community that's being ripped apart by the council.
""It's not fair whatsoever that they've made a decision to do this... We care about our school so much.""
Councillor Ian Cooper, cabinet member for children's services, said: ""Proposing the closure of the school is very much the last resort and not something we have taken lightly.
""During recent years it has experienced a dramatic decline in pupil numbers, which are forecast to drop even more over the next three years, as well as results below the national minimum standards.

"Linda Norgrove, from Lewis, had been working in Afghanistan when she was seized by rebels in September 2010.
She was killed during a rescue attempt by US special forces.
Linda Norgrove Foundation is helping Ascend, a project that teaches mountaineering skills to young women in Afghanistan.
Last year, Ascend supported a team of 13 women climbed three peaks over 16,000 feet, including one previously unclimbed mountain which they subsequently named.
As they did not have enough boots for everyone, the women climbed in two teams, one getting use of the boots before swapping over so the others could go up.
Linda's mother, Lorna Norgrove, said: ""We were hugely impressed by what this project is doing for women's empowerment in Afghanistan. News of their achievements has already reached more than 4 million Afghan women and the project is changing the lives of these young women for ever.
""I think the project particularly resonated with us because as a family we are all keen hillwalkers and climbers.
""We know Linda would have loved this project and we're sure that it will appeal to the many people in the UK who enjoy climbing the hills and mountains. We take for granted the freedom to climb the hills, but this is something which can change lives for these young women in Afghanistan.""

"The four-piece group and their manager, who were aged between 19 and 32, died in the early hours of 13 February following a gig in Stockholm.
Their car crashed into a raised section of a bridge and plummeted into a canal.
The inquest heard no alcohol or drugs was found in the blood of manager Craig Tarry, 32, who was driving.
Post-mortem examinations also showed the four band members had not taken drugs and had only consumed small amounts of alcohol.
The band's agent Graham Bennett told the inquest at Warrington Coroner's Court that the up-and-coming group were in Sweden for a festival showcasing young artists.
Viola Beach had already played at the Reading and Leeds festivals last year and the Stockholm event was their first gig outside the UK.
After the performance, they were travelling in a black Nissan Qashqai near the SÃ¶dertÃ¤lje Canal, about 18 miles from the capital, when a bridge was raised to let a boat pass underneath.
The inquest heard that the car was slightly over the speed limit as it was travelling at 108km/h (67mph) in a 100km/h zone.
Flashing lights signalled that the bridge was about to be raised with the middle section of the road lifted horizontally, the inquest heard.
Mr Tarry drove down a verge past stationary queuing traffic and through the first set of barriers, about 120m from the bridge, the court heard.
The car then travelled in a ""controlled manner"" at between 70 and 90km/h down the centre of the road.
It continued through a second set of barriers - 30m from the drop into the canal - and hit the raised section of the bridge before plummeting 25m, hitting the water within 15 seconds.
The court heard a tanker using the canal, which had requested the bridge to be lifted, then passed over the crash spot and ""contact"" with the car could not be ruled out.
The crew of a passing boat saw the car fall but initially thought it was ice.
Technical examinations did not find any errors with the car, barrier system or the procedure for raising the bridge.
One warning light on the bridge was out of order but there were at least 10 warning lights and flashing signals, the inquest heard.
Although the road was wet, it was not frozen with ice.
Post-mortem examinations found that all died from head injuries apart from Mr Lowe whose cause of death was given as drowning.
The court heard that the three band members sitting in the back of the car were not wearing seatbelts but those in the front were, and had to be cut from the vehicle.
Cheshire Coroner Nicholas Rheinberg said ""none of the young men will have suffered"" as they died.
The Swedish authorities have recommended improvements to the crossing, including LED signs and cameras on the bridge.
In the wake of their deaths, the band's first single Swings & Waterslides reached number 11, while their song Boys That Sing was performed by Coldplay in a tribute at Glastonbury.
Posthumously, Viola Beach scored a number one album in August.

"The new rates will be implemented in October and will benefit a million workers.
Business Secretary Vince Cable said he had accepted a recommendation from the Low Pay Commission that the minimum wage should increase by 3%.
It is the first time in six years that the rise will be higher than inflation.
The rate for 18 to 20-year-olds will go up by 10p to £5.13 an hour, a 2% increase.
The rate for those aged 16 and 17 will rise by 7p to £3.79, also a 2% rise.
Apprentices will earn an extra 5p an hour, taking their wages to at least £2.73.
The consumer prices index (CPI) rate of inflation is currently 1.9%.
""The recommendations I have accepted today mean that low-paid workers will enjoy the biggest cash increase in their take-home pay since 2008,"" said Mr Cable.
He also suggested that all companies should consider helping their staff to share in the fruits of an improving economy.
""I urge businesses to consider how all their staff - not just those on the minimum wage - can enjoy the benefits of recovery,"" he said.
Meanwhile, the man who set up the minimum wage 15 years ago, said it is in need of major reform.
Professor Sir George Bain, founding chair of the Low Pay Commission, said the benchmark was a ""child of its times"" when launched in 1999.
But speaking to BBC Newsnight on Wednesday, he said it had become a ""blunt instrument"" and that many employers could now afford to pay their workers much more.
""If you set it at the 'living wage', which is about £7.65 an hour, you would cause massive unemployment in areas like retail and social care,"" Sir George added.
""But there's only about five sectors where this is true. There's a whole range of sectors where you could easily afford to pay more than the minimum wage.""
Sir George, who has chaired a review of the minimum wage for think-tank the Resolution Foundation, also said there should be a ""special case for London to have a higher national minimum"".
His report also recommends that the Low Pay Commission give longer-term forecasts for the benchmark, to help employers plan for the future.
The latest rise means the national minimum wage is still well below the definition of low pay, as set by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).
This equates to two-thirds of the median full-time hourly wage - about £7.71 an hour. About five million UK workers currently earn below that level.
The latest figure is also well below the living wage, which is £8.80 per hour in London, and £7.65 in the rest of the country.
""Across the country, people are struggling to make ends meet,"" said Dave Prentice, the head of the Unison trade union.
""The sooner we move to a living wage, the better,"" he said.
In January this year, Chancellor George Osborne said he backed the idea of the national minimum wage reaching £7 an hour by October 2015.
The latest announcement could pave the way for that to happen, but it would need a rise of more than 7% next year to do so.
Unite, the country's biggest trade union, said the rise announced was ""timid"".
""To make matters even worse, George Osborne cruelly held out hope that the rate would rise to £7,"" said Len McCluskey, Unite's general secretary.
""The government claims it is on the side of working people but companies are sitting on a cash mountain of £500bn and they should be forced to share more of it with the lowest paid,"" he added.","The national minimum wage will increase by 19p an hour to £6.50, the government has announced.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But with the lowest turnout in the constituency's history and a margin of 2,620 the narrowest ever recorded in this once proud Labour heartland, can this declaration really be believed?
It's a bright and windy day in Stoke-on-Trent.
The town has been at the centre of the political spotlight for weeks now, but people seem more interested in discussing the aftermath of Storm Doris than the small matter of Stoke Central's by-election result.
This staunch working class community was once passionately behind Labour.
In 1951, more than 60,000 went to the polls - 34,260 backing Labour.
Rather than feel victorious about Gareth Snell's win, Labour voters willing to talk simply seem relieved Paul Nuttall didn't clinch it.
In all, 7,853 voted for Mr Snell, compared to 5,233 who wanted UKIP to win.
Wendy Wright, 51, from Newcastle-under-Lyme, thought the vote for UKIP may have been higher had it not been for its disastrous campaign.
""I'm not surprised Labour won because of the way UKIP handled the campaign,"" she said.
""The people of Stoke seemed to think he [Paul Nuttall] didn't come from the area and they didn't believe his pack of lies.
""It's a relief UKIP didn't get in but [Labour retaining the seat] just means things are going to stay the same.""
Ms Wright said there had not been a high turnout because ""people aren't interested in politics"".
She said: ""They've kind of lost faith and lost hope. They think, what's the point, nothing's going to change.
""It's a deprived area and it's a shame because the people are so welcoming and friendly.""
Veronica Millington, 71, from Blythe Bridge, said she and husband Anthony, 75, were ""Labour through and through"".
They backed Mr Snell in the by-election and also voted to stay in the European Union.
""I think the people of Stoke do care about politics and they want to make things better,"" she said.
""I think they were misled by UKIP in the beginning. They seemed to promise them so much and people saw it as a new chance really.
""It was only when all the lies came out they saw how many wrong things had been said.""
Mr Millington, 75, expressed concern about why so few people bothered to go to the polls.
""The turnout seemed to be very low and I think a lot of people think it was a foregone conclusion.
""They thought the Labour Party would win. Now whether or not they've had a jolt from the outsider now, I don't know.""
For a city that has had such a strong relationship with the Labour party, the changing political landscape over the past seven decades reveals a lot about the strength of feeling in the community.
Labour has won all 18 elections since since the inception of the Stoke Central constituency, with the Conservatives coming second until 2001.
But although Labour enjoyed a heyday in the 1960s and 70s, their share of the vote has consistently fallen over the years down to a record low of 37% in this by-election.
So why did this city of proud, working class voters fall out of love with Labour?
""Things started to change because of a growing alienation of the people of Stoke-on-Trent from Westminster,"" says Prof Mick Temple from Staffordshire University.
""Industry was decimated in the 1980s - coal, steel and the Potteries.
""When I first came here [in the early 90s] infrastructure was poor, schools were poor and still today, unemployment is higher than the national average.""
From the closure of Shelton Steel Works - where 10,000 once worked - to the shrinking of its famous pottery industry, the people of Stoke-on-Trent have lived through some turbulent times.
But the bleak images of derelict factories and houses often shown by the media are not a true reflection of the passion and pride of a community that is fiercely proud of its heritage.
Data shows 6.2% of adults in Stoke Central claim unemployment benefit, far higher than the national average of 3.8%.
In recent years employers such as Bet365, Michelin Tyres and Goodwin have invested millions of pounds into their businesses, providing jobs for thousands of people.
Hanley's famous pottery industry is also enjoying something of a resurgence, with Emma Bridgewater investing more than Â£1m in its thriving ceramics factory.
Middleport Pottery, home of world-famous Burleigh, is in the national spotlight thanks to the success of BBC Two's The Great Pottery Throw Down.
Millions of pounds are being spent regenerating the city.
For many people though, the investment has been too little, too late.
""The feeling is that the city has been passed by Westminster and the EU, and that is why people voted Leave so overwhelmingly,"" says Prof Temple.
""There are many towns in the north of England where people feel the same - areas that are ripe for UKIP.""
From 2005, the BNP and UKIP began to resonate with voters, coming fourth and fifth in that year's election and again in 2010.
By 2015, UKIP had won so much support its candidate Mick Harold came second to Tristram Hunt for a seat that had the lowest voter turnout in the whole of the UK.
Pub owner Tony Flackett, 69, backed Paul Nuttall in Thursday's poll.
""It feels sad, it's such a shame, they've worked really hard and people have come from all over the country.
""I've always voted for Conservatives but the last two years I voted UKIP because of Brexit and immigration.
""But life goes on and at least they reduced the margin.""
Tom Wilson, 26, voted for UKIP in the by-election and said he was ""very upset"" at the result.
""I think Labour winning is very bad news for Stoke-on-Trent.
""There has been years of neglect in Stoke with money spent only on Hanley.
""I think only UKIP would have made a change for the people of Stoke.""
UKIP has made moves to appeal to former Labour voters, as well as those who formerly backed the Tories.
""They're more pro-State, pro-NHS. They recognise that strong nationalistic message supported by the working class,"" says Prof Temple.
Between the 2001 and 2011 Censuses, the non-white population doubled and there was a relatively high population of Muslims, he said.
""I'm not saying the response was a racist one - Stoke-on-Trent was getting less and less money from the government and the EU and the feeling was the traditional working class community was being overtaken.
""Many working class voters felt they could not express their views within the Labour party.
""The BNP and UKIP gave them a chance to say how they felt.""
Now Mr Snell is the town's new MP, the challenge is on for him to win back the trust of former Labour supporters and engage with new ones.
Lee Woolrich, 33, from Stoke-on-Trent, is head of client services for a digital agency but did not vote in the by-election.
""I'm ashamed really that I didn't use my vote, but I almost don't think I invest enough in politics to make an informed decision,"" he said.
""I don't think young people are engaged in politics. I think they are more so recently because of what's happened in America.
""I read about Paul Nuttall and some of his views and policies and I don't believe it's what we need here.""
Mr Woolrich believes politicians need to take more of an interest in Stoke-on-Trent - he too feels the place has been forgotten and is badly represented by the media.
""Stoke is doing great without those kinds of ideas.
""I love the developments in Hanley and the cultural quarter.
""Stoke is showing signs of change and getting in line with cities like Manchester.
""On a local level, I like the direction things are going in but I don't necessarily think government in London will listen to the people of Stoke.
""I hate that stigma that Stoke isn't a nice place to live.
""It doesn't do the place justice. It's a beautiful city steeped in history.""
And Prof Temple agrees. ""It's a much more attractive place,"" he said.
""I've been here for 24 years, I've lived all around the world and this is the friendliest, most coherent community I've ever known.
""Stoke-on-Trent has an identity most places in the UK have lost.
""There's a very strong sense of community. It's a place where friendship and family is still strong.""","In the wake of his victory, Stoke Central's new Labour MP Gareth Snell claimed it had been a triumph for the ""politics of hope"".",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Under-20s coach Murty has been in charge for three Premiership matches following Mark Warburton's departure.
And his side responded to defeats at Dundee and Inverness CT by beating St Johnstone 3-2 at Ibrox for his first Premiership win in charge.
""He's been brilliant,"" said midfielder Hyndman, who scored the late winner again Saints on Wednesday night.
""It's always a tough position as a kind of interim manager, especially with the way things have gone,"" on-loan Bournemouth midfielder Hyndman added.
""But I credit him for coming in and establishing what he wants us to do. I think the boys got behind him quite well.
""The results didn't really show what he was doing and how good he was but it was nice to give him that positive feeling on Wednesday night.""
Rangers are expected to appoint a new head coach next week, after Saturday's Scottish Cup quarter-final at home to Hamilton Academical.
And with the Premiership gap between third-placed Rangers and second-placed Aberdeen now cut to six points, USA international Hyndman says there is still plenty to play for this term.
""Of course there is,"" he said. ""We saw the Aberdeen result the other night (1-0 defeat at Hamilton) but we're just focused on ourselves at the same time.
""We need to get ourselves right and I think we took our first step against Saints. It was about the three points, it wasn't about how we got it.
""After recent results we've had it was very important we got three points on the board and thankfully we did that.""
Fellow loan player Jon Toral, who joined Rangers from Arsenal in January, was also keen to praise Murty.
""It was massive for Graeme on Wednesday,"" said the Spaniard. ""He has put a lot of effort into the other games as well, he has really helped us and for us to give him that first league win was crucial.
""At the minute we are just thinking about the cup tie on Saturday and then whatever happens happens. If a new manager has until the end of the season to work with the players and then to kick on next season it would be great for the club.""",Emerson Hyndman believes interim Rangers boss Graeme Murty deserves huge credit for the job he has done.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A report by technology news site Gizmodo said staff responsible for what was shown to Facebook's 1.6bn users frequently chose to bury articles they did not agree with.
Responding to the allegations, the network's head of search Tom Stocky wrote that the site ""found no evidence that the anonymous allegations are true"".
The claims come weeks after Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg publicly denounced the policies of likely US presidential nominee, Donald Trump.
""I hear fearful voices calling for building walls and distancing people they label as 'others.',"" the 31-year-old said at his firm's recent developers conference.
However, Facebook insisted Mr Zuckerberg's view did not influence what stories are given added visibility on the network.
The Trending Topics column appears in the top right corner of a typical Facebook page. It is designed to highlight what subjects are being discussed heavily by Facebook users around the world.
Facebook explained in a statement that this list was edited by humans so as to avoid regularly recurring popular topics - such as ""lunch"".
Facebook's Mr Stocky explained: ""Popular topics are first surfaced by an algorithm, then audited by review team members to confirm that the topics are in fact trending news in the real world and not, for example, similar-sounding topics or misnomers.""
The Gizmodo story, which quoted a person it said they had been one of the editors, alleged Facebook staff were routinely tampering with Trending Topic stories.
Gizmodo's source added that staff were told to seek out stories published on the BBC, CNN and other mainstream sites ahead of publications with a clearly stated political bias - even if the stories originated on those smaller outlets.
Also, if several mainstream media sites were covering the same story, Facebook would - according to the source - artificially place it in the Trending Topic column, even if it was not being discussed heavily by users.
Breitbart, one of the leading conservative news sources in the US, said the reports confirmed what they had ""long suspected"", that ""Facebook's trending news artificially mutes conservatives and amplifies progressives"".
The anonymous source also claimed that stories staff favoured - such as the Black Lives Matter movement - were given artificially greater prominence. Facebook said that this was ""untrue"".
After a day of growing reports across social media and in conservative-leaning publications, Facebook's Mr Stocky posted a response on his profile.
""We have in place strict guidelines for our trending topic reviewers as they audit topics surfaced algorithmically,"" he wrote.
""Reviewers are required to accept topics that reflect real world events, and are instructed to disregard junk or duplicate topics, hoaxes, or subjects with insufficient sources.
""Facebook does not allow or advise our reviewers to systematically discriminate against sources of any ideological origin and we've designed our tools to make that technically not feasible.
""At the same time, our reviewers' actions are logged and reviewed, and violating our guidelines is a fireable offense.""

Major Peake added that he was now into the final phase of training, in which he was focusing on the essentials.
He said astronaut training had been rigorous and involved retaining immense quantities of information.
Tim Peake is the first Briton to be selected as an astronaut for the European Space Agency, through a route backed by the UK government.
He was in Houston, Texas, when he spoke live to schoolchildren at Queen's Park Primary School in West London. The event was organised as part of a UK Space Agency programme called Esero, which is designed to use space to help enhance science education.
""I'm immensely proud to be British and to be serving in the European Space Agency,"" he told BBC News.
""It's always very apparent to me, wherever I'm travelling, whether it be Houston, here, or Russia, that you're wearing the flag and you're representing your country.""
Major Peake, who was a British Army helicopter pilot before his selection for the astronaut corps, is set to fly to the International Space Station in December on a Russian Soyuz rocket.
He will be accompanied on the launch from Baikonur Cosmodrome by the American astronaut Timothy Kopra and the Russian Yuri Malenchenko.
The Briton said the training was now ""ramping up"" as the 15 December launch date approached.
""The training is a long process and we've covered such a huge variety of subjects. One of the main challenges is actually being able to retain all of that information over a two-and-a-half-year period,"" he said.
""I'm in the final six months before launch and we're just focusing on the essentials of the Soyuz spacecraft, emergency training... and scientific payloads that are going to be on the space station.""

Major Peake believes the flight will bring significant benefits to the country and British industry.
""This is a step forward in that it's the UK government supporting human spaceflight,"" he explained.
""What that means is that UK industry, UK education and the UK scientific community can now embrace human spaceflight.

"It means BP will have to make the payments that stem from the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig.
BP argued that the deal meant it could fall prey to inflated or bogus compensation claims.
BP agreed to the compensation deal in 2012, but argues it has been misinterpreted.
Shares in BP fell 1.7% in London on Monday.
BP asked the Supreme Court to consider whether people and businesses seeking payments under the settlement included individuals who had not actually suffered any injury as a result of the oil spill.
The Supreme Court's rejection of this appeal by BP is the latest in a series of setbacks for the oil firm.
BP is trying to limit payments over the environmental disaster, which claimed the lives of 11 people and became the largest US offshore oil spill in history.
The settlement agreement has no cap, but BP initially estimated that it would pay roughly $7.8bn (Â£6.1bn) to compensate victims.
It now says it can no longer give a reliable estimate for how much the deal will cost.
BP has already paid out $2.3bn in so-called business economic loss claims out of a total of $4.25bn in compensation claims to individuals and businesses, according to Patrick Juneau, the administrator appointed by the courts to handle claims.
The settlement process is also separate from other court proceedings relating to the spill, including environmental and criminal penalties.
BP has set aside $43bn to resolve all claims.

The revamp was originally scheduled to end in 2026 but the firm now says it will finish in 2033.
Camden Council has warned the extended works will ""blight"" the area, but HS2 says it will be ""easier to manage"".
The station is set to gain six new platforms and an additional concourse, with building works due to start in 2017.
In a change to plans submitted two years ago, HS2 Ltd has proposed the construction of five further platforms within the existing station should be delayed.
They would be ready for phase two of HS2 which will run from the capital to Leeds and Manchester in 2033.
Rupert Walker, Euston development director of HS2 Ltd, said: ""It is more construction over a longer period but it's less intense. It will be easier for us to manage.""
The impact of building all 11 platforms in one go would have caused a reduction in the capacity of trains using Euston every day, he said.
Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said the changes would ""dramatically improve the design"" of the station.
Sarah Hayward, leader of Camden Council, predicted: ""HS2 will cause decades of blight in the Euston area - to property prices, to our small business' trade and to our residents' lives.""

"Plans for a £41m revamp of the central London street, including a daylight ban on cars six days a week, were approved by Camden Council in 2014.
The Licensed Taxi Drivers Association (LTA) said it was ""madness"" and would hinder customer pick-up and drop-off.
It sought a judicial review of the decision that was refused on 1 June.
The council said the redesign would make the street safer and support businesses ahead of the opening of a Crossrail station in 2018.
It undertook an assessment of the impact the partial car ban might have and said allowing taxis to use the street would lead to more traffic congestion, worse air quality and increased traffic collisions.

"Mr Miliband called the prime minister's refusal to take part unless the Green Party was involved a ""pathetic excuse"".
He said he would debate with ""anyone invited by the broadcasters"".
But Mr Cameron said the Labour leader was ""chickening"" out of facing the Greens and all ""national parties"" must be represented.
The exchanges came after Mr Miliband, Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg and UKIP leader Nigel Farage urged broadcasters to press ahead with televised debates before the 7 May poll even if Mr Cameron refuses to take part.
The three leaders have written to Mr Cameron saying it would be ""unacceptable"" for the prime minister to refuse to appear, saying an empty podium should be provided in his absence.
In response, the BBC, Sky News, ITV and Channel 4 said they ""remain committed"" to staging debates before the poll on 7 May.
Raising the issue in Parliament, Mr Miliband said Mr Cameron had argued back in 2010 that it would be ""feeble"" for any party leader to walk away from the debates but was now threatening to do just that.
A high stakes poker game in which the ultimate prize is power - that is what the row about TV leaders election debate has now become.
The players at the table are not just the nation's party leaders but also the bosses of the country's biggest broadcasters.
Watching and waiting are highly paid lawyers who know that this may end up being resolve by a judge and not by the court of public opinion.
The question is - will anyone blink before it gets to the court-room?

""It is not for him, it is not for me, it is not for any party leader to decide who is in the debate,"" he said. ""It is up to the broadcasters, that is the country we live in.
""I think he does protest too much. He has run out of excuses, he is running scared of these debates and in the words of his heroine Margaret Thatcher 'he is frit'"".
Mr Cameron said Mr Miliband wanted ""to debate having a debate"" because he did not want to talk about the economy and other issues.
He said he was keen to defend his record during the campaign, suggesting he would support the idea of two debates, one a head-to-head encounter between him and Mr Miliband and another in which all ""national parties"" were represented.
""The more time he and I can spend on television and in the television studio, the happier I will be,"" he said.
But Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, who was sitting next to the prime minister, was heard shouting ""excuses, excuses"" as Mr Cameron answered one of Mr Miliband's questions.
In identical letters to Mr Cameron, Mr Miliband, Mr Clegg and Mr Farage called for a repeat of the 2010 debates - the first ever leaders' TV debates in a British election - and insisted they ""not the property of the politicians"".
They wrote: ""I believe it would be a major setback to our democratic processes if these debates were not repeated in 2015 because of one politician's unwillingness to participate.""
The added: ""Therefore, if you are unwilling to reconsider, the three party leaders who have committed to participate will ask the broadcasters to press ahead with the debates and provide an empty podium should you have a last-minute change of heart.""
Under plans put forward by the BBC, Sky News, ITV and Channel 4 in October, the pre-election live TV debates would include the Conservatives, Labour, Liberal Democrats and UKIP.
Mr Cameron would take on Labour leader Mr Miliband head-to-head in one debate, another would feature Mr Cameron, Mr Miliband and Lib Dem leader Mr Clegg, and a third would also include UKIP's Mr Farage.
The suggested schedule is for debates on 2 April, 16 April and 30 April, ahead of the general election on 7 May.
Mr Farage said the BBC would be ""within its rights"", under the terms of its editorial guidelines, to stage a debate without Mr Cameron and providing an empty podium would be ""entirely appropriate"".
""If David Cameron chooses not to turn up that is his hard luck,"" he told the BBC News Channel. ""My guess is that if the broadcasters hold firm, Mr Cameron will buckle and say yes.""
Lord Ashdown, who is leading the Lib Dems' general election campaign, urged broadcasters to ""stick to their guns"" or else he feared the impetus for the debates would ""ebb away"".
He told Sky News: ""You just can't let the prime minister or anybody else basically hold the country and our democracy to ransom by saying no.""
But Green Party leader Natalie Bennett said she backed Mr Cameron's stance and said it was in the interest of the three other leaders to help persuade broadcasters that her party should be included in one of the debates.
Ms Bennett said ITV had not yet made a final decision and she hoped to hold talks with the broadcaster in the near future.
""Staging the debates without the prime minister might score a point but would not serve the public, who rightly expect the political parties and the broadcasters to find a format that is acceptable to all concerned,"" she wrote in a letter to the trio.
""If you indicated that you were open to the inclusion of the Greens, then I feel sure that ITV would respond.""
John Curtice, professor of politics at the University of Strathclyde, said that having ""nailed his colours to the mast"" over the Green Party's participation, it would be difficult for Mr Cameron to shun the debates if they were invited.
The three debates in 2010 were watched by a total of 22 million people, and they have been cited as one reason for the increase in turnout at the election, which rose for the first time since 1992.
While the debates were a ""good test of political leadership"", Prof Curtice told the BBC that they had dominated the campaign and ""not necessarily succeeded in reaching out to more marginal voters"".
The SNP and Plaid Cymru, which have more seats in Parliament than either UKIP or the Green Party, also say they should be represented in any series of debates.
SNP deputy leader Stuart Hosie said: ""The idea that the SNP, bigger than UKIP and the Lib Dems combined in terms of membership, should be excluded from debates which are broadcast into people's homes in Scotland is just simply quite unacceptable.""
In a statement, the four broadcasters said: ""The debates played an important role in informing millions of our viewers in 2010 and we will continue to work with all the parties to ensure that they happen again in 2015"".
The Guardian, Daily Telegraph and YouTube are proposing a separate digital debate, which they suggest could reach up to 55 million internet users.

"The East Midlands Trains service was travelling at 65mph (105 km/h) when it derailed at Barrow on Soar in Leicestershire in February 2008.
The train derailed after an engineering works tipper lorry hit a footbridge.
Leicester Crown Court heard the firm did not have a proper construction site safety assessment in place.
A train driver had to be cut free from his cab after the bridge collapsed in the accident, but no-one else was hurt.
A warning message had been sent out, but the Nottingham-to-Norwich passenger train was unable to stop in time.

"Prof Higgs, who does not own a mobile phone, said a former neighbour had pulled up in her car as he was returning from lunch in Edinburgh.
He added: ""She congratulated me on the news and I said 'oh, what news?'""
The woman had been alerted by her daughter in London that Prof Higgs had won the award, he revealed.
He added: ""I heard more about it obviously when I got home and started reading the messages.""
The 84-year-old emeritus professor at the University of Edinburgh was recognised by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences for his work on the theory of the particle which shares his name, the Higgs boson.
He shares this year's physics prize with Francois Englert of Belgium, and joins the ranks of past Nobel winners including Marie Curie and Albert Einstein.
The existence of the so-called ""God particle"", said to give matter its substance, or mass, was proved almost 50 years later by a team from the European nuclear research facility (Cern) and its Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in Geneva, Switzerland.
Speaking for the first time about the award at a media conference at the University of Edinburgh, he said: ""How do I feel? Well, obviously I'm delighted and rather relieved in a sense that it's all over. It has been a long time coming.""
An old friend told him he had been nominated as far back as 1980, he said.
Prof Higgs added: ""In terms of later events, it seemed to me for many years that the experimental verification might not come in my lifetime.
""But since the start up of the LHC it has been pretty clear that they would get there, and despite some mishaps they did get there"".
Stressing the involvement of other theorists and Cern, he added: ""I think clearly they should, but it is going to be even more difficult for the Nobel Committee to allocate the credit when it comes to an organisation like Cern.
""I should remind you that although only two of us have shared this prize, Francois Englert of Brussels and myself, that the work in 1964 involved three groups of people, (including) two in Brussels.
""Unfortunately Robert Brout died a few years ago so is no longer able to be awarded the prize, but he would certainly have been one of the winners if he had still been alive.
""But there were three others who also contributed and it is already difficult to allocate the credit amongst the theorists.
""Although a lot of people seem to think I did all this single-handed, it was actually part of a theoretical programme which had been started in 1960.""
Prof Higgs was born in Newcastle, but developed his theory while working at the University of Edinburgh.
The landmark research that defined what was to become known as the Higgs boson was published in 1964.
Discovering the particle became one of the most sought-after goals in science, and the team of scientists behind the $10bn LHC at Cern made proving its existence a key priority.
In July of last year, physicists at Cern confirmed the discovery of a particle consistent with the Higgs boson.
Prof Higgs, who had often been uncomfortable with the attention his theory brought, was in Geneva to hear the news, and wiped a tear from his eye as the announcement was made.
Reacting to the discovery at the time, he told reporters: ""It's very nice to be right sometimes.""",Nobel Prize-winning scientist Prof Peter Higgs has revealed he did not know he had won the award until a woman congratulated him in the street.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"The unnamed woman had agreed Greater Manchester Police (GMP) could refer to her experience in a training session providing she remained anonymous.
However, she later learned her identity and medical history were disclosed to a wider audience.
GMP has apologised and said ""steps"" had been taken to stop similar occurrences.
The victim's solicitor said the payout was believed to be one of the biggest by a British force in a privacy case.
In a witness statement, the woman, who agreed to an out-of-court settlement, said she ""felt betrayed by GMP"".
The errors in this case by Greater Manchester Police almost beggar belief. Safeguarding victims is the most important priority in domestic violence police work.
Revealing a victim's identity, medical history and distressed 999 call, against their wishes, represents very grave mistakes. This episode is hardly likely to increase victims' confidence in the police.
The case also illustrates the use of part of the civil law that has principally been seen in cases involving celebrities whose privacy has been breached by newspapers.
'Misuse of private information' has been argued in a number of cases. It relies on a breach of Article 8 of the 1988 Human Rights Act; the right to respect for a private and family life.
The claimant has to establish they have a reasonable expectation of privacy in relation to the information concerned, and that privacy has been breached.
The media can argue the claimant's right to privacy is outweighed by the right to freedom of expression and that there is a public interest in publishing. The police have no such defence.
This case shows that Article 8 is not simply for celebrities and that public bodies, such as the police, can be sued if they breach it.
Nick McAleenan, from JMW Solicitors, described his client as a ""successful, professional woman"".
He said she ""suffered psychiatric harm"" after learning that her personal information was disclosed and that a tape of her 999 call following an assault was played at a training session.
He added that GMP had initially refused to accept it had done anything wrong and its internal investigation concluded that no officer had infringed the police code of conduct.
In May 2014, the force admitted breaching the woman's privacy but refused to acknowledge she had suffered distress or loss as a result which would entitle her to any damages.
Mr McAleenan said: ""This is information out there in the public domain. She can't put the genie back in the bottle and it's something that she is going to have to live with for the rest of her life"".
A GMP spokeswoman said it was ""an exceptional case"", adding: ""The force has taken action to protect the individual's information to prevent any issue in the future.""
She added: ""We have apologised to the woman involved... This was an unacceptable mistake; however, it was done with the best of intentions as part of training for partner agencies around recognising the signs of domestic abuse.""
A spokesperson from the domestic abuse charity, Women's Aid, said: ""Survivors of domestic abuse should be able to expect the highest standards from the police - and the police should be extremely careful when dealing with survivors.
""The survivor in question could have been put in a very dangerous situation; highly manipulative perpetrators of domestic abuse will stop at nothing to find out where their former partner is, or to gather information on them.""","A domestic abuse victim has received £75,000 from a police force after it revealed details of her treatment by a former boyfriend without her consent.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The Liverpudlian is second on 3,932 points, 40 behind leader and reigning champion Brianne Theisen-Eaton.
Johnson-Thompson has said her main aim this weekend is to get the 6,200 points needed for Rio.
She needs 2,268 points on Sunday in the three remaining events.
The 23-year-old began the day equalling her personal best of 13.37 seconds in the 100m hurdles and followed it up by clearing 1.92m in the high jump, a personal best outdoors.
After two events, Johnson-Thompson was in the overall lead but slipped to sixth following a disappointing 11.55m in the shot put - the worst mark in the field and 1.59m below the personal best she set earlier in the season.
She made amends for that poor display with a personal best 22.79 secs in the 200m, which pulled her closer to Canada's world silver medallist Theisen-Eaton.
Johnson-Thompson will start with the long jump on Sunday, the event which ruined her chances of gold at last year's World Championships following her failure to record a legal jump.
She said: ""I'm sure I'll be nervous again in the long jump. I really want to get a good jump in the first round.
""This is my first big competition especially after a knee operation last autumn so I just want 6,200 points and to be injury free and to be going home with my ticket for the Olympics.""
The Briton has also said her experience in Beijing changed her, created a ""new Kat"" who is determined to bounce back and quash her demons.
Her performances on the opening day in Austria promised much not only for this competition but the summer ahead.
Although she has repeatedly said Olympic qualification rather than regaining the title she won in 2014 is her priority this weekend, she looks set to vie with favourite Theisen-Eaton for first place.
And despite a poor display in the shot, her weakest event, Johnson-Thompson will take heart that she achieved her best heptathlon score of 6682 points in Gotzis two years ago, when her total after the opening day was also 3923.
The long jump, javelin and 800m remain on Sunday but fellow Brit Morgan Lake - adrift of her personal bests in all four events on the first day - is likely to fall short of the total needed for Rio.
Lake - recording 14.43 secs in the 100m hurdles, 1.86m in the high jump, 13.18m in the shot put and 26.12 secs in the 200m - is 29th overall.

"A ceremony, attended by PM Shinzo Abe, was held at Hiroshima's memorial park before thousands of lanterns are released on the city's Motoyasu river.
The bombing - and a second one on Nagasaki three days later - is credited with bringing to an end World War Two.
But it claimed the lives of at least 140,000 people in the city.
A US B-29 bomber called the Enola Gay dropped the uranium bomb, exploding some 600m (1,800ft) above the city, at around 08:10 on 6 August 1945.
On that day alone, at least 70,000 people are believed to have been killed. Many more died of horrific injuries caused by radiation poisoning in the days, weeks and months that followed.
People across Japan have observed a minute's silence to mark the anniversary. In Hiroshima a bell tolled at 08:15 local time - when the US aircraft dropped the bomb that flattened the city centre.
Addressing 40,000 people who attended the commemoration ceremony at Hiroshima's peace park near the epicentre of the 1945 attack, Mr Abe called for worldwide nuclear disarmament.
He said that that atomic bomb not only killed thousands of people in Hiroshima but also caused unspeakable suffering to survivors.
""Today Hiroshima has been revived,"" the prime minister said, ""and has become a city of culture and prosperity.
""Seventy years on I want to reemphasise the necessity of world peace.""
Mr Abe and Hiroshima Mayor Kazumi Matusi were joined by US Ambassador to Japan Caroline Kennedy for the official ceremony of remembrance on Thursday, which included silent prayers, the release of doves and a declaration of peace.
Mr Matsui described nuclear weapons as an ""absolute evil"" while urging the world to put an end to them forever.
""To coexist we must abolish the... ultimate inhumanity that is nuclear weapons. Now is the time to start taking action,"" he said in his annual speech.
Later in the day, thousands of paper lanterns will be released on the city's Motoyasu River - symbolising the journey to the afterlife of those who died.
The anniversary comes as divisions in Japan rise over Mr Abe's bid to pass unpopular legislation to expand the country's military role worldwide.

"Biffa says that its crews found 93 people sleeping in rubbish last year.
It says the cameras, fitted to 140 of its 800 trucks, would remind staff to check bins before emptying them.
Last year four people sheltering in bins died when they were tipped into the back of trucks.
Biffa's Tim Standring told BBC Radio 4's You and Yours the cameras would give drivers extra ""peace of mind"" and that some vehicles would also record footage from inside hoppers.
The company was not spying on its staff, he said, saying the move was designed to protect them from the ""anguish"" of not realising a person had been inside the bin.
Mr Standring, the firm's divisional health, safety, environment and quality coach, said: ""If it's the only place you've got to stay and it's the most secure place I can kind of see the appeal, but the down side of it is if we don't find you, you're not going to survive.""
He added: ""Once you're in the hopper, the blade comes down and it crushes and breaks the waste and it will take it back into the body [of the vehicle] where it's compacted again.
""These machines won't differentiate between cardboard, wood and unfortunately people as well.""
Biffa hopes that all of its refuse lorries will have the new technology by the end of the year.

"The Gobbins coastal path in Islandmagee was the brainchild of Irish railway engineer Berkley Deane Wise.
It first opened in 1902 and quickly became famous as a white knuckle walk.
Edwardian era visitors were able to have a close encounter with waves and wildlife.
The path, which is carved into black basalt cliffs, was an engineering triumph - it's connected by a network of walkways and bridges - the most iconic of which was the tubular bridge.
Post-war austerity spelt decline for the 1.5 mile walkway and it was closed to the public in the 1950s.
Since then only seabirds have enjoyed the stunning views from this part of our coastline.
Rumblings down the years about restoring the path finally turned into action in 2013, when the restoration project got under way.
Since then, £7.5m has been spent replacing bridges, hand rails and constructing a new visitors centre.
The tubular bridge has been replaced with an almost identical replica.
While modern engineering methods have made the work safer, construction worker Paul Montgomery says he has an enhanced respect for those who built the original path.
""They did an immense job, because the beams I have seen from the old bridges were concrete cased and to get them down here would have been a feat in itself as there were no cranes in those days,"" he said.
""So I have a lot of respect for them.""
While health and safety is more of a concern nowadays some things have not changed, including the steep walk down to the starting point - a hole through rock known as Wise's eye.
Before starting the Gobbins experience, visitors are given a safety briefing and a hard hat in the visitors centre, it's then on to a minibus for the two-mile journey to the path.
The walk is described as strenuous and is not suitable for everyone.
No-one under the height of 1.2m will be permitted, a good level of fitness is required and people with cardiac, respiratory, asthmatic or joint conditions are urged not to attempt it.
The route allows visitors to see coastal birds such as puffins, guillemots and kittiwakes up close. It's also possible to spot porpoises off the coast.
This attraction has created some much needed employment in the area and one of the tour guides is Robert Stewart, a local farmer who has decided to try something new.
""I'm very enthusiastic about my new job,"" he said.
""Everybody knows about the Giant's Causeway but I think we have something here that can compete with the Giant's Causeway and is just as beautiful.""
Groups of 10 to 15 will be guided along the bridges which cling to the cliff face just metres above the sea.
Tours should be booked in advance and the costs are £8.50 for adults, concessions £6 and a family rate of £23.
There will also be a cliff top walk which will be free for the public and has a viewing platform that hangs over the cliff.  This element of the work is not expected to be complete until September.
The project is over a year late and £1.5m over budget, but Mid and East Antrim Council has big hopes for the attraction and is expecting 50,000 visitors a year.
Tourism Minister Jonathan Bell, who walked the path on Tuesday, said it was ""staggeringly beautiful"".
""It is something that you could bring visitors from anywhere in the world to and be very proud of the quality of the tourism offering,"" he said.
""Having done it, I think it represents real value for money and puts Northern Ireland with another - and I genuinely mean this -  top quality, international tourist destination.""
The council's mayor Billy Ashe said it was fantastic for the area.
""I think that first and foremost it will put us back on the map,"" he said.
""Berkley Deane Wise thought that this path could be one of the world's attractions - I agree with him.

"Jason Woodward's try put them ahead but Josh Bassett, Tommy Taylor and Joe Simpson scored as Wasps went in ahead.
Christian Wade, Guy Thompson and Bassett went over for the visitors for a bonus point, which deflated Bristol.
The hosts rallied, Jack O'Connell and Nick Fenton-Wells touching down, but it could not stop them from going down.
Having finished top of the Championship in five seasons before finally winning promotion in the play-offs last year, Bristol will return to the second-tier at the first time of asking.
After Worcester's win over Bath on Saturday, Mark Tainton's Bristol needed two points from the game to prolong their relegation battle, but they lacked a clinical streak.
It leaves them 12 points adrift at the bottom of the table, with a maximum of 10 points on offer from their final two matches.
Wasps were far from at their best, on the back foot for much of the game, but have restored their five-point lead at the top and need one win from their last two to secure a home semi-final in the play-offs.
The Premiership's top try-scorer Wade, on his 100th appearance for Dai Young's side, did his England hopes no harm with his 16th score of the campaign.
Bristol were promoted to the top tier on 25 May after winning their two-legged play-off final, with the Premiership season starting just 100 days later.
Director of rugby Andy Robinson, a former England head coach, was sacked in November after his side lost their first 10 games of the campaign.
Tainton took interim charge and Bristol finally got their first league win against Worcester on Boxing Day, following it up with victory at Sale and a losing bonus point at Northampton, but it was a false dawn.
The scrapping of the Championship play-offs, meaning the team that finishes top will gain automatic promotion, may give Bristol more time to plan ahead next season if they are successful.
Connacht boss Pat Lam will have the task of bringing Bristol back into the Premiership, having signed a three-year deal in December to become head coach from June.
Tainton will remain at the helm for their final two matches at Saracens and at home to Newcastle, and remains optimistic about the future of the club.
""Obviously it's disappointing to get relegated, but we've put a plan in place whether we were going to stay in the Premiership or get relegated,"" he said.
""We have the infrastructure at Ashton Gate to be a Premiership team - we're not going to be next year, but hopefully the supporters will still watch us in that league.
""Bristol more than most know what a difficult league it (the Championship) is, but hopefully we can bounce back very quickly.""

""It was a similar story to a lot of games - we've created an awful lot, we've been in the opposition 22 many times but we've just not executed and got across the line.
""We give Wasps an opportunity and they score tries, it's as simple as that - that's the difference in the level we need to get to.
""We were down and beaten in the second half but we played right until the very end of the game - I expect that from them in the next two games.""
Wasps director of rugby Dai Young:
""Obviously there are still things to work on, especially our starts - I thought our first 10 minutes, again, we made far too many mistakes and gave ourselves a bit of a hill to climb.
""We just had enough to do it but we make it hard for us really - there's room to improve in every area, but I'm pretty pleased and felt we looked in control for most of the game.
""It's up to us to nail it (a top-two finish) ourselves - we're not relying on other people.""

"Virginia Raggi said more arrivals could exacerbate social tension.
Her call follows local elections on Sunday in which the Five Star Movement performed poorly.
More than 500,000 people have arrived by boat since 2014. Nearly 200,000 are being housed in  centres across the country.
""We cannot permit the creation of more social tensions,"" Ms Raggi said on Facebook.
""That is why I am saying it is impossible, risky even, to think about creating any new reception structures.""
The interior ministry has asked all Italian municipalities to find space for an expected 250,000 new migrants this year, up from about 180,000 last year.
Some observers say Ms Raggi is attempting to win back support by targeting migrants after her party failed to make the run-off in 24 of the main 25 cities choosing a new mayor.
About half of Italians do not want the country to take in more people, pollster Renato Mannheimer told Reuters news agency.
Italy is accommodating rising numbers of migrants because countries to the north have tightened their borders and some EU states have refused to take part in a plan to relocate 160,000 people from Italy and Greece.
Just over 20,000 migrants have so far been relocated under the plan and the EU has begun legal action against against Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic for refusing to accept refugees.
An estimated 40% of the migrants in Italy have a valid claim to asylum or leave to remain on humanitarian grounds, AFP news agency reported.
The others are deemed to be illegal economic migrants and face deportation, but this can be difficult to arrange in practice because their countries of origin sometimes refuse to take them back.
A note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.","The mayor of Rome, who is from the anti-establishment Five Star Movement, has asked Italy's government not to send more migrants to the city.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"South Sudan's defensive tactics paid dividends as they held on for a point.
After beating Djibouti 2-0 in their opening Group C game on Monday it puts South Sudan in line to qualify for the quarter-finals of the tournament.
""We are happy that we have picked a point against a strong Sudan side,"" said South Sudan's goalkeeper Juma Ginaro after the game.
""We now wait to face Malawi in our last group game.""
The draw leaves Sudan in third place behind their neighbours with just a single point so far after they lost 2-1 to Malawi in their first match.
Guest team Malawi top the group and have qualified for the last eight after brushing aside Djibouti 3-0.

"The Direct Energie rider took advantage of a lapse in concentration from Team Sky's Nicolas Roche to beat the Irishman in a sprint finish.
Roche was also second in the overall standings, six seconds behind Voeckler.
Bury's Adam Yates (Orica) was Britain's highest finisher, as he was third in the stage and fourth overall.
Sunday's final stage, a 198km route from Middlesbrough to Scarborough, contained six categorised climbs.
Team Sky set a punishing pace in wet and gruelling conditions after taking it on at half distance and with 44km to go they had five riders at the head of the leading group.
Roche attacked on the ascent at Harwood Dale and took with them Voeckler, Yates, Anthony Turgis (Cofidis) and Steven Kruijswijk (LottoNL).
It was Voeckler who clung on the to back of Roche as the Team Sky sprinter attacked again in the descent into Scarborough.
Voeckler, who finished third last year after missing out in a sprint finish, used that experience to employ some cat and mouse tactics, as he tracked Roche along the resort's seafront in front of huge crowds on the town's famous grass banks.
Roche suffered a momentary lapse in concentration, causing him to look the wrong way as Voeckler flew past him with the finishing line in sight to leave his rival in his wake.
Voeckler told ITV4: ""It wasn't just with the strength in my legs that I used, but also my head.
""It was difficult to follow the attack of Team Sky at the climbs, so I decided on a little more patience.
""Then I knew to launch the sprint at 300 metres. Although it was early, with the wind at my back, it was not so bad.""
And in a tribute to the Yorkshire public that came out in huge numbers despite persistent drizzle, he added: ""I feel like this is home because the crowd were shouting my name.""

"Research from the Institute for Policy Studies found that in 2014, bonuses paid to Wall Street employees had been double the annual pay earned by all Americans who worked full-time at the federal minimum wage.
So, 167,800 Wall Street employees were paid $28.5bn (£18.2bn) in bonuses, while 1,007,000 full-time minimum wage earners made about $14bn.
One particularly eye-catching blog on the subject carried the headline: ""If You Own a Pitchfork, You Will Grab It When You See This Chart"".
I wondered if this statistic was also true in the UK.
The best proxy we have for the Wall Street bonus pool is the ONS figure for bonuses paid in the finance and insurance sector, the most recent figure for which was £14.4bn in the financial year 2013-14.
The Low Pay Commission says that excluding apprenticeships there were 1.3 million jobs in 2014 that paid the National Minimum Wage (NMW) of which 40% were full-time, so that's about 520,000 jobs.
Assuming everyone earned the highest level of minimum wage, the average level of the NMW for 2013-14 was £6.25.
If we assume that they worked 37.5 hours a week (that's the average number of full-time hours given in the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings for 2014) and that they work 48 weeks a year, their total earnings come to £5.9bn, which is less than half the amount paid in bonuses by the finance and insurance sector - it's about 40%.
Before you go and buy a pitchfork, remember that there are differences between this figure and the US one. For example, the bonuses in the UK finance and insurance sector were shared between more than a million employees - considerably more than on Wall Street. There were people paid very high bonuses but also people paid much more modest ones. The average overall was £13,300, but I would expect that to mask quite a range.
But the other question is, what is this an indicator for and what would make it rise or fall?
So, for example, imagine that 100,000 people earning minimum wage suddenly received a pay rise of £1 an hour. They would no longer be earning minimum wage, so the total amount paid to workers on the minimum wage would fall considerably and as a result the amount paid out in bonuses would be a higher multiple of it. But it would be hard to argue that their pay rise had increased inequality.
Nonetheless, if you were outraged by the figure from the US then you will be just as outraged that the same appears to be true in the UK.",A statistic in March provoked outrage in the US media about inequality.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The force said mental health issues resulted in 141,230 lost days among front-line officers.
The Liberal Democrats said the figures showed evidence of a force ""being stretched to breaking point"".
The Scottish government said the welfare of officers and support staff was taken ""very seriously"".
Police Scotland released the figures to the Lib Dems under Freedom of Information laws.
The party's justice spokesman Liam McArthur said police officers and civilian staff were not getting the support they needed from the Scottish government.
He said: ""The savings that were promised by the SNP before the creation of Police Scotland have not materialised.
""As a result, officers and civilian staff are being asked to do more and more with less. With the chief constable warning that further cuts are coming, the pressure on staff is only likely to get worse.""
He added: ""We have already seen staff surveys which show morale is at rock bottom. The shortages are affecting the health of officers and civilian staff and these new figures are a huge concern.
""Policing is a high-stress profession at the best of times. The changes that the SNP forced through are stretching the mental health of officers and civilian staff to breaking point.
""This means giving police management the freedom to put resources where they are needed.
""Extra money is also required to plug the hole in the national force's budget and avert the loss of staff which would only put those remaining further under the cosh.""

The spokesman added: ""They have a number of targeted activities to support wellbeing and occupational health across the organisation.
""We have committed to protecting the police revenue budget in real terms, safeguarding policing from Westminster budget cuts and delivering an additional Â£100m of investment by the end of this parliament, in addition to Â£55m of reform funding in 2016-17.""

"Current Yes keyboardist Geoff Downes tweeted: ""Utterly devastated beyond words to have to report the sad news of the passing of my dear friend, bandmate and inspiration Chris Squire.""
Squire had revealed he was suffering from a rare form of leukaemia.
The band said he died ""peacefully"" in Phoenix, Arizona, on Saturday night.
""It's with the heaviest of hearts and unbearable sadness that we must inform you of the passing of our dear friend and Yes co-founder, Chris Squire,"" a statement on the band's official Facebook page said.
Squire had revealed in May that he had been recently diagnosed with acute erythroid leukemia, which would force him to miss the band's summer co-headlining tour with Toto.
Yes were formed in 1968 when singer Jon Anderson met self-taught bassist Squire in London.
Their big break came a year later when they signed to Atlantic Records after opening for Janis Joplin at London's Royal Albert Hall. Their debut single, Sweetness, and first album, Yes, were released later that year.
Other albums included 1971's Fragile, 1972's Close To The Edge and 1977's Going For The One.
In 1983 they released the album 90125, which featured their classic hit Owner Of A Lonely Heart. That went on to become a US number one hit in January 1984 despite only reaching number 28 in their home country.
Squire also released a solo album, Fish Out Of Water, in 1975.
The group's most recent studio album, Heaven & Earth, came out last year.
Squire, who was born in Kingsbury, north-west London, was the only member of the group to feature on every studio album.
Musicians and fans took to Twitter and Facebook to pay tribute to Squire.
John Petrucci, founding member and guitarist for American progressive metal band Dream Theater, tweeted: ""Thank you for all of the amazing music Chris Squire. You will surely be missed.""

"The Blues, who had keeper Thibaut Courtois sent off, were down to nine men for a period after staff ran on to treat Hazard following a trip, despite him not appearing to be badly injured.
If a player receives treatment, they must leave the field.
""I was unhappy with my medical staff. They were impulsive and naive,"" Mourinho told Sky Sports.
""Whether you are a kit man, doctor or secretary on the bench you have to understand the game.
""You have to know you have one player less and to assist a player you must be sure he has a serious problem. I was sure Eden did not have a serious problem. He had a knock. He was tired.""
Chelsea were already struggling to cope against Swansea's extra man before Hazard was tripped by Gylfi Sigurdsson with six minutes remaining, leading to Mourinho's frustration.
It was an eventful match for Premier League champions Chelsea. Courtois suffered an injury scare in the warm-up before he was was dismissed in the 52nd minute after bringing down Swansea striker Bafetimbi Gomis.
Replacement goalkeeper Asmir Begovic came on for his debut after an £8m move from Stoke, with opening goalscorer Oscar making way. Gomis scored the resulting penalty.
""I don't want to talk about it,"" Mourinho said of the referee's decision.
After Oscar's opener, Andre Ayew equalised on his Swansea debut but the visitors only held on for 95 seconds before Federico Fernandez scored an unfortunate own goal to gift Chelsea a 2-1 lead.
Following defeat by Arsenal in last Sunday's Community Shield, Chelsea again looked rusty, having returned from a pre-season tour of North America where they travelled 9,800 miles.
Mourinho said: ""Swansea didn't have chances against 11 men. The team was playing very, very well in the first half.
""In one minute, it was a penalty, red card and the goal.
""If you have 10 men and are winning you can defend well and try to find a strategy but to play with 10 men and try to win the game is more difficult. I would say we were the best team with 11 players and with 10 we fought hard, some fighting at the limit of their condition.""

"Last year, Beijing banned any more ""bizarre"" buildings. In recent years the country has seen buildings shaped like a teapot and another resembling a pair of trousers.
Now, China's State Administration for Industry and Commerce has continued the government's crusade for normalcy with restrictions on such names as 'scared of wife' or 'prehistoric powers'.
So, just how weird and wonderful are Chinese company names? Well, a few otherwise-unoccupied social media users in China have dug up some gems.
Some curiosities have crept into business names from internet memes.
""Shenyang Prehistoric Powers Hotel Management Limited Company"" might sound weird but less so to Chinese sports fans who remember swimmer Fu Yuanhui.
She famously won a bronze medal at the Rio Olympics, afterwards declaring: ""I have used all my prehistoric powers to swim!""
There are also lots of restaurants and cafes with the phrase ""skinny blue mushroom"".
The phrase originated from a meme which mocked a man from Guangxi province who uploaded a video of himself talking about his loneliness while his girlfriend was away.
""Unbearable, I want to cry,"" he moaned - but thanks to his accent, it ended up sounding more like ""skinny blue mushroom"".
One of the best known offbeat names on Chinese social media is a condom company called ""Uncle Niu"".
Or, more accurately, ""There Is a Group of Young People With Dreams, Who Believe They Can Make the Wonders of Life Under the Leadership of Uncle Niu Internet Technology Co Ltd.""
It's not concise, but at least it's positive.
Others aren't so upbeat, especially when it comes to home life.
And given ""Beijing Scared of Wife Technology Company"" and ""Anping County Scared of Wife Netting Products Factory"" are both registered companies, the trend doesn't seem to be limited by industry or region.
The rules of written Chinese are vastly different to those of written English, so many names seem far stranger in translation than in the original tongue.
English names can seem pretty strange in Chinese too, and there's a cottage industry among branding agencies to help western companies come up with names for the Chinese market.
Western company names often follow the name of their founder (think Boeing, Ford or Gucci), which might have no direct translation.
Or they might be a concocted portmanteau (think Verizon, which is the Latin word ""veritas"" meaning truth, with horizon bolted on to the end) or maybe even just tech nonsense (Etsy, Hulu).
""What we think is most important to come up with a name that captures the spirit of the brand,"" says Tait Lawton, from Nanjing Marketing Group, which provides naming services.
Western companies sometimes try to phonetically replicate the original, or come up with a Chinese name that's fairly neutral in meaning.
Others will come up with a new name that tries other ways of encapsulating the brand.
""BMW's current Chinese name is 宝马. It's great. The first character means 'treasure' and the second character means 'horse'. The sound is 'bao ma', starting with a B and M. Plus, it's short. It just has a great feel to it,"" says Mr Lawton.
He has a few other examples he likes too.
Pampers, for example, is 帮宝适 or ""bang bao shi"", which means ""helps make baby comfortable"".
Walch soap 威露士 or ""wei lu shi"" loosely translates as ""mighty liquid guard"", and who wouldn't want to wash with that?",China has banned companies from registering weird and long names.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mr Ramos Allup is the secretary general of the social-democratic Democratic Action party, which has long been opposing the socialist government of President Nicolas Maduro and his predecessor in office, Hugo Chavez.
The government says Mr Ramos Allup is a member of Venezuela's ""old guard"". His Democratic Action was one of two parties that alternated in power for four decades before President Hugo Chavez was elected president in 1998.
But his supporters say the 72-year-old has the experience and political savvy to turn the National Assembly into a counterbalance to President Maduro's executive branch.
Mr Ramos Allup said the MUD opposition coalition, which won a two-thirds majority in the National Assembly, would show Venezuelans ""a more democratic way forward"".
Known for his sometimes confrontational style, he struck a surprisingly conciliatory note after his election.
""We represent an alternative. We are not going to be anti-establishment, rather an autonomous legislative power,"" he said.
""We ask people to watch us, to demand more of us, and keep an eye on what we do to make sure we honour our commitment,"" he added.
Nevertheless, the first session of the assembly is expected to be tense after the opposition coalition said all of its 112 members would take up their seats even though three have been suspended by the Supreme Court pending investigations into alleged voting irregularities.
Tension is also expected to be high around the National Assembly building, as both the opposition and the governing Socialists have called on their supporters to converge on the building.",Venezuelan opposition lawmakers have chosen a veteran politician as the new head of the country's legislative body.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Aqsa Mahmood, 20, travelled to Syria from her Glasgow home to become a ""Jihadi bride"" in November 2013.
The Daily Mail reported she had been in touch with at least one of the three London girls, who are aged 15 and 16.
The trio are thought to have flown to Turkey in an attempt to enter Syria.
Shamima Begum, 15, Kadiza Sultana, 16,  and an unnamed 15-year-old girl, who all attended Bethnal Green Academy in Tower Hamlets, travelled to Turkey on Tuesday.
They were interviewed by police after another girl from their school went to Syria in December but were not considered as a risk.
In a statement released through their lawyer Aamer Anwar, the Mahmood family said they were ""full of horror and anger that their daughter may have had a role to play in the recruitment of these young girls to Isis"".
They also sent a message to Aqsa: ""You are a disgrace to your family and the people of Scotland, your actions are a perverted and evil distortion of Islam.
""You are killing your family every day with your actions, they are begging you stop if you ever loved them.""
The statement also said the UK security services had questions to answer.
It added: ""Aqsa's social media has been monitored since she disappeared over a year ago, yet despite alleged contact between the girls and Aqsa, they failed to stop them from leaving the UK for Turkey, a staging post for Syria.
""Sadly, despite all the government's rhetoric on Isis, if they can't even take basic steps to stop children leaving to join Isis, what is the point of any new laws?""
Privately educated Mahmood travelled through Turkey to Aleppo in Syria, where she married an Islamic State fighter.
She was reported to have later encouraged terrorist acts via a Twitter account under the name Umm Layth. The account has since been deleted.
Speaking in September, her parents Khalida and Muzaffar Mahmood said their daughter had attended Craigholme School, then university and was ""well integrated into society"".

"Eight Type 26 frigates are due to be built on the Clyde, but the UK government has not announced a timescale for the project.
Harriet Baldwin faced calls from SNP and Labour MPs to confirm a time-frame for cutting steel on the frigates.
But she said it would be ""inappropriate"" to do so as negotiations continue.
Work had originally been due to start this year, but SNP defence spokesman Brendan O'Hara predicted during a Commons debate on Tuesday that construction of the ships would not start until at least the summer of next year.
He also said the delays could be in part blamed on the economic impact of Brexit, as well as the government committing too much of its procurement budget to renewing the Trident nuclear deterrent.
Mr O'Hara told MPs: ""It would be an unforgivable betrayal of the Clyde workers if they were the ones that had to pay the price of Brexit, but also the price of Trident.""
In reply, Ms Baldwin told the Westminster Hall debate: ""The timing of the award of the build contract and the build schedule itself are key components of the ongoing commercial negotiations between the Government and BAE Systems.
""We are negotiating a deal that aims to optimise the requirements of the Royal Navy in terms of the capability the ships will deliver, to achieve value for money for defence and the taxpayer, and to deliver a build schedule that drives performance.
""These negotiations are continuing, so I am not this afternoon in a position to give a specific date as to when an agreement will be reached.
""To protect the commercial interests of the Ministry of Defence, disclosing any such detail would be inappropriate at this time.""
Under questioning from the SNP's Chris Stephens, Ms Baldwin confirmed the national ship building strategy will report by the time of the Autumn Statement on 23 November, which could reveal fresh information about plans for the Type 26 frigates.
Ms Baldwin also resisted calls to disclose further reasons behind delays and cuts to the project.
The project has already been cut from 13 to eight new ships, while a target to start cutting steel in May has been delayed indefinitely.
Tory MP Bob Stewart, a former British Army officer, said: ""I don't think we need the minister to answer that - the answer is we had no money.
""That's why we had to cut down the number of Type 26 ships. We did not have the money, and we actually had to cut our means to suit our coat.""

"The role is widely regarded as the biggest job in British theatre, and Norris called it ""a great honour"".
""I am thrilled at the challenge of leading this exceptional organisation, where it has been a privilege to work under the inspirational leadership of Nick Hytner,"" he said.
Sir Nicholas announced last April he would step down in March 2015.
Norris first came to prominence in 2001 with his production of Afore Night Come at the Young Vic, for which he won the Evening Standard award for most promising newcomer.
Having initially trained at Rada as an actor, the 48-year-old has since directed theatre in the West End and on Broadway, as well as having experience with opera and film.
In 2012 his film Broken premiered at the Cannes Film Festival before winning best British independent film at the British Independent Film Awards.
He recently directed The Amen Corner at the National and also created Dr Dee: An English Opera with Blur frontman Damon Albarn for the Manchester International Festival in 2011.
Earlier this year he also launched the National's temporary Shed venue on London's Southbank with Table, by his playwright wife Tanya Ronder.
""The National is an extraordinary place full of extraordinary people and I look forward with relish to the task ahead,"" Norris said.
""That being to fill our theatres with the most exciting, accessible and ground-breaking work our unique and broad community of artists has to offer.""
Sir Nicholas will have spent 12 years as the National Theatre's director when he hands over to Norris in 2015.
He has overseen worldwide hits such as The History Boys, War Horse and One Man, Two Guvnors, as well as NT Live which screens theatre productions in cinemas.
He said his successor would be ""welcomed with great excitement both within the National and in the theatre at large"".
He added: ""His work as a director is always searching, deeply considered and adventurous and I have no doubt he will bring these qualities to the running of the National.""
Sir Nicholas said Norris received a standing ovation from the National Theatre company when he had introduced him earlier, accompanied by a huge roar ""even louder than when old Alfie falls down the stairs in One Man, Two Guvnors"".
Norris said his new role was ""a great privilege and I will attack that with gusto"", adding he would like to ""cast the net wider"" in terms of who would perform at the theatre.

""He fits the bill. There are certain echoes between him and Hytner which no doubt appealed to the board.
""The main thing is that neither of them, upon being appointed, had run buildings before. They both enjoyed stellar careers as freelance directors which, firstly, indicates the board wants to have an artist at the head rather than a career artistic director and, secondly, they want someone with new ideas.
""He's had a fascinating career. Festen at the Almeida (2004) was a stellar production and proved that work fostered in a subsidised theatre could transfer to the commercial West End.
""The key with him is that he can direct at the Olivier (The Amen Corner, London Road, Death and the King's Horseman) and on a smaller scale at The Shed (Table).
""He's proved he has the ability to direct across the board.""

""The theatre's in a different place from when Nick [Hytner] took over - a position of strength.""
Norris revealed he was directing a movie version of London Road in 2014, but said he would be ""100% committed to this building"" from the moment Sir Nicholas leaves.
""I'm not going to kid myself. I will be chained to this place,"" he added.
Norris, who has been an associate director at the National Theatre since 2011, will take up his new position from April 2015.
He is the first former actor as well as non-Oxbridge graduate to be appointed since Sir Laurence Olivier, who was the National's first artistic director in 1963.
""There have been many times in my life when I've regretted that I played in bands and was a painter decorator for four years when I could have been at university, but I seem to be here - it worked out,"" Norris said.
""The simple fact is, lots of people who go to Oxford and Cambridge are very, very clever. That doesn't mean they're the only clever people.""
The National Theatre's chairman John Makinson said: ""The Board looked for an individual with a creative reputation that would command the respect and support of British theatre, and with the generosity of spirit that has characterised Nick Hytner's period as director.
""Rufus Norris has both those qualities in abundance. He is an exciting choice, someone who will build on the National Theatre's present reputation as one of the most admired and innovative performing arts organisations in the world.
""We are fortunate that he has chosen to join us.""
The National Theatre's first director from 1963-73 was Sir Laurence Olivier, who is widely considered to be one of the greatest actors of all time.
When asked by the BBC's Arts Editor Will Gompertz whether he thought his acting past would also bring a different flavour to the institution, Norris laughed: ""It's an interesting question and one I had not anticipated at all, because to compare me as an actor with Laurence Olivier is one of the funniest things I've heard in a long time.""
He continued: ""I'm sure that what I bring to it will be nothing like the amount of skill and expertise that his acting career allowed him to bring to the table.
""But I think, yeah, training as an actor and having that experience for a while gives you an insight into a certain aspect of the process which is very, very useful.""
Sir Kenneth Branagh, Stephen Daldry, Danny Boyle and ex-Donmar Warehouse bosses Michael Grandage and Sam Mendes had all been in the frame for the job, although Mendes had ruled himself out of the race.

The five-year civil war between the Moscow-backed government and the Islamist-led opposition, in which up to 50,000 people were killed and over one-tenth of the population fled the country, ended in 1997 with a United Nations-brokered peace agreement.
Tajikistan's economy has never really recovered from the civil war, and poverty is widespread. Almost half of GDP is earned by migrants working abroad, especially in Russia, but the recession in 2009 threatened that income. The country is also dependent on oil and gas imports.
Economic hardship is seen as a contributing to a renewed interest in Islam - including more radical forms - among young Tajiks.
Tajikistan has been accused by its neighbours of tolerating the presence of training camps for Islamist rebels on its territory, an accusation which it has strongly denied.
Tajikistan has relied heavily on Russian assistance to counter continuing security problems and cope with the dire economic situation. Skirmishes with drug smugglers crossing illegally from Afghanistan occur regularly, as Tajikistan is the first stop on the drugs route from there to Russia and the West.
Russia maintains military garrisons in Tajikistan and in 2004 took back control over a former Soviet space monitoring centre. These developments were widely seen as a sign of Russia's wish to counter increased US influence in Central Asia.

"She was 12 at the time and living with her parents and two siblings in northern Peru.
On that night, two officials came to their home and took away her father.
Mr Katsura, who owned a small general store, was arrested because he was part of Peru's prosperous Japanese community.
""My father told them he hadn't done anything wrong, but they didn't listen to him,"" she recalls.
Japanese people began migrating to Peru in considerable numbers at the end of the 19th Century, drawn by opportunities to work in the mines and on sugar plantations.
By the 1940s, an estimated 25,000 people of Japanese descent lived in Peru. Many had become lawyers and doctors, or owned small businesses.
Their prosperity, further fuelled by racism, soon triggered anti-Japanese sentiment in Peru, Stephanie Moore explains.
Ms Moore, a scholar at the Japanese Peruvian Oral History Project, says after the outbreak of World War Two, the Japanese community in Peru became a target, and their assets were confiscated.
""In May 1940, as many as 600 houses, schools and businesses belonging to citizens of Japanese descent were burned down,"" she says.
Following Japan's 1941 attack on the US naval base at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii, the US government asked a dozen Latin American countries, among them Peru, to arrest its Japanese residents.
Records from the time suggest the US authorities wanted to take them to the US and use them as bargaining chips for its nationals captured by Japanese forces in Asia.
Mr Katsura was among the 2,200 Latin Americans of Japanese descent who were forcibly deported to internment camps in the US.
Blanca Katsura, who is now 83 and lives in Northern California, remembers how she learned of his fate.
""A month after my father was detained, he sent me a letter because it was my birthday,"" she recalls.
""He had been taken to Panama from where they were planning to send him to the US,"" she adds.
Six months later, Blanca Katsura's mother decided to take her three small children to the US to search for her husband.
""When we arrived in New Orleans after a month-long trip, they confiscated our passports and then sent us by train to the Crystal City camp.""
As many as 4,000 people were interned during World War Two in this camp in Texas run by the US Immigration and Naturalization Service.
Most of the detainees were of Japanese descent, although some German and Italian immigrants were also held there.
It was at Crystal City that Blanca Katsura was reunited with her father. ""I was shocked, he had lost so much weight,"" she remembers.
For the next four years, her family lived in the barracks at the camp.
Her memories of that time are not particularly traumatic, she says.
""Being a child at the time time, I had no worries and made lots of friends.
""We were able to go to school and learn Japanese,"" she adds.
Ms Katsura says she later learned that the camp authorities were keen for the children to learn Japanese so they would be able to speak the language once they were deported to Japan.
Chieko Kamisato's memories of life at Crystal City are less positive.
""You could call it a concentration camp, because we were surrounded by barbed wire fences and guards with guns,"" she says.
""We couldn't go out at all, although we were free to move around inside,"" she recalls.
""My parents were really bitter about the situation because they were forced to come to the US. They had no choice,"" she says.
Ms Kamisato's father had moved to Peru from Japan in 1915 and had worked hard to open a bakery in the capital, Lima.
Now 81, she lives in Los Angeles.
Of the 2,200 Latin Americans of Japanese descent to be interned in the US, 800 were sent to Japan as part of prisoner exchanges.
After World War Two ended, another 1,000 were deported to Japan after their Latin American home countries refused to take them back.
Ms Katsura's and Ms Kamisato's families successfully fought deportation and were eventually allowed to remain in the US.
In 1988, then-President Ronald Reagan signed the Civil Liberties Act and apologised on behalf of the US government for the internment of Japanese-Americans.
Under the act, the government paid tens of thousands of survivors of the camps $20,000 (Â£13,000) each in reparation.
But Japanese-Latin Americans did not qualify for the payments because they had not been US citizens or permanent residents of the US at the time of their internment.
Outraged, they filed a class-action suit and 10 years later, the US government agreed to pay them $5,000 each.
Most accepted, but a small group headed by camp survivor Art Shibayama decided to hold out, demanding to be paid the same as Japanese-Americans.
Blanca Katsura says that even though her childhood at the camp may not have been traumatic, no amount of money can compensate her family for its loss.
""My parents wanted to go back to Peru but couldn't. They missed the life they had there,"" she recalls.
""The Peruvian government sold us out to the US government and that is not a very nice feeling. How would you feel about it?""",Blanca Katsura will never forget the night of 6 January 1943.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"John Griffith-Jones was asked at a Treasury Select Committee hearing whether the Treasury had leant on the FCA or undermined its independence.
He said that the ""simple answer"" was ""no to both"".
Acting chief executive Tracey McDermott said the suggestion was ""nonsense"".
Two senior FCA figures were speaking at a committee hearing called after it emerged that the inquiry, described as a ""thematic review"", had been scrapped.
The FCA had planned to look at whether pay, promotion or other incentives had contributed to scandals involving banks in the UK and abroad.
Ms McDermott told the committee the review had been shelved because ""we didn't think that we would be able to put out something that was sufficiently useful or valuable to make it worthwhile spending resources and time on doing it"".
She said the review would have duplicated other work carried out elsewhere, notably by the Banking Standards Board, which was ""looking at precisely the same issue"".
She said the FCA was now seeking to ""build on work done by other bodies"" and would be focusing on individual firms through regulatory supervision.
Banks around the world have faced huge fines from regulators for their involvement in numerous scandals.
In May last year, the news agency Reuters calculated that 20 global banks had paid Â£152bn in fines and compensation to customers since the 2008 financial crisis.","The chairman of the City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), has said political considerations played no part in its decision to shelve an inquiry into the culture of banking.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Their rise to third place in the polls comes despite a string of pre-election scandals.
One local candidate stood down after a picture emerged of her wearing a swastika armband.
Another was highlighted for posting racist and anti-immigrant comments online.
And yet, the revelations appear to have had little obvious effect on voters, even if the mainstream parties do not want anything to do with the party.
They are led by the dapper and clean-cut Jimmie Akesson, 35.
Voters also seemed unperturbed by the news that he has gambled half a million kronor (Â£43,000; 54,000 euros; $70,000) online.
""Every crisis the party gets into Mr Akesson handles very efficiently,"" says Ulf Bjereld, professor of political science at the University of Gothenburg, who sees him as a very skilful politician, if uncharismatic.
Any political party would struggle to fend off accusations of racism, he told the BBC, but the party leader simply took them off the list and said they were not welcome.
They will now occupy 49 seats in Sweden's 349-seat parliament.
By publicly stressing the Sweden Democrats' zero tolerance towards racism for the past two years, he has been careful not to fall out of step with the tolerance that Swedes believe they have towards ethnic minorities.
In contrast with other EU countries, Sweden is granting automatic residence to all refugees fleeing the Syrian conflict and some 80,000 people are expected to apply for asylum this year.
The Sweden Democrats have carefully refined their 2010 election platform, when their campaign commercial featured an elderly woman pushing slowly towards a welfare desk.
""You can choose if you want to save money from the pensions or immigration budgets,"" ran the commentary, over menacing music.
The pensioner is overtaken by a group of women in burqas.
The party made it into parliament in 2010 with 5.7% of the vote, five years after Jimmie Akesson took on the leadership.
Beforehand the party had been linked for years to neo-Nazis and other extremist groups.
In a speech in August, he identified himself as a nationalist but called for his party to show they were ""broad and inclusive"".
But he was forthright on the risks of political Islam.
""Islamism is the Nazism and communism of our time. It has to be met with disgust and much stronger resistance than has so far been the case.""
The anti-immigration rhetoric has been toned down and carefully argued, with a policy of preferring to help refugees in their own countries.
There are obvious parallels with France's National Front which, under the leadership of Marine Le Pen, has moved into the political mainstream.
The two parties go back many years, and Ms Le Pen visited Jimmie Akesson last year in Stockholm. A few months ago he praised the National Front's ""modern, quite fresh direction"".
That does not mean the Sweden Democrats have shaken off their past but, with two MEPs in the European Parliament, they are now part of the same grouping as the Eurosceptic UK Independence Party - the Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy group.
Swedish voters are attracted to the party, more because it gives a voice to people who dislike the political elite than its stance on immigration, Prof Bjereld believes.
And although he argues that party membership will always have a racist element, the main stance is more xenophobic than racist.
""One of Jimmie Akesson's skills is that he sends one message to the racists in his party and another to the general public.""","They see themselves as the kingmakers of Swedish politics and, after polling 13% in national elections, the far-right Sweden Democrats are now difficult for mainstream parties to ignore.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Hills Quarry Products has submitted a planning application to the county council for a sand and gravel quarry near the village of Clifton Hampden.
It said the development, known as Fullamoor Quarry, will see 2.5m tonnes of earth extracted over 10 years.
But residents said the plan poses a threat ""to the health and wellbeing"" of their communities.
Chairman of campaign group Bachport (Burcot and Clifton Hampden Protection of the River Thames) Ian Mason said: ""It's vital that people express their deep concerns.
""A quarry would devastate a tranquil part of the Oxford Green Belt bordering the Thames and we fear more flooding as the proposed site is in the flood plain.""
He added that the biggest concern was the traffic a quarry would generate, with 570 lorry movements a week.
Hills Quarry Products director Peter Andrew said the application followed an 18-month public consultation, which included meetings with residents.
He said: ""As a result of the feedback received, we significantly reduced our plans in relation to the volumes of material we hope to extract and the time we will take to work the site.
""The final restoration plans were also scaled back so that no additional material is brought on to site, which in turn reduced the overall number of vehicle movements.""

"Linda Norgrove, from Lewis, had been working in Afghanistan when she was seized by rebels in September 2010.
She was killed during a rescue attempt by US special forces.
Linda Norgrove Foundation is helping Ascend, a project that teaches mountaineering skills to young women in Afghanistan.
Last year, Ascend supported a team of 13 women climbed three peaks over 16,000 feet, including one previously unclimbed mountain which they subsequently named.
As they did not have enough boots for everyone, the women climbed in two teams, one getting use of the boots before swapping over so the others could go up.
Linda's mother, Lorna Norgrove, said: ""We were hugely impressed by what this project is doing for women's empowerment in Afghanistan. News of their achievements has already reached more than 4 million Afghan women and the project is changing the lives of these young women for ever.
""I think the project particularly resonated with us because as a family we are all keen hillwalkers and climbers.
""We know Linda would have loved this project and we're sure that it will appeal to the many people in the UK who enjoy climbing the hills and mountains. We take for granted the freedom to climb the hills, but this is something which can change lives for these young women in Afghanistan.""

"The four-piece group and their manager, who were aged between 19 and 32, died in the early hours of 13 February following a gig in Stockholm.
Their car crashed into a raised section of a bridge and plummeted into a canal.
The inquest heard no alcohol or drugs was found in the blood of manager Craig Tarry, 32, who was driving.
Post-mortem examinations also showed the four band members had not taken drugs and had only consumed small amounts of alcohol.
The band's agent Graham Bennett told the inquest at Warrington Coroner's Court that the up-and-coming group were in Sweden for a festival showcasing young artists.
Viola Beach had already played at the Reading and Leeds festivals last year and the Stockholm event was their first gig outside the UK.
After the performance, they were travelling in a black Nissan Qashqai near the SÃ¶dertÃ¤lje Canal, about 18 miles from the capital, when a bridge was raised to let a boat pass underneath.
The inquest heard that the car was slightly over the speed limit as it was travelling at 108km/h (67mph) in a 100km/h zone.
Flashing lights signalled that the bridge was about to be raised with the middle section of the road lifted horizontally, the inquest heard.
Mr Tarry drove down a verge past stationary queuing traffic and through the first set of barriers, about 120m from the bridge, the court heard.
The car then travelled in a ""controlled manner"" at between 70 and 90km/h down the centre of the road.
It continued through a second set of barriers - 30m from the drop into the canal - and hit the raised section of the bridge before plummeting 25m, hitting the water within 15 seconds.
The court heard a tanker using the canal, which had requested the bridge to be lifted, then passed over the crash spot and ""contact"" with the car could not be ruled out.
The crew of a passing boat saw the car fall but initially thought it was ice.
Technical examinations did not find any errors with the car, barrier system or the procedure for raising the bridge.
One warning light on the bridge was out of order but there were at least 10 warning lights and flashing signals, the inquest heard.
Although the road was wet, it was not frozen with ice.
Post-mortem examinations found that all died from head injuries apart from Mr Lowe whose cause of death was given as drowning.
The court heard that the three band members sitting in the back of the car were not wearing seatbelts but those in the front were, and had to be cut from the vehicle.
Cheshire Coroner Nicholas Rheinberg said ""none of the young men will have suffered"" as they died.
The Swedish authorities have recommended improvements to the crossing, including LED signs and cameras on the bridge.
In the wake of their deaths, the band's first single Swings & Waterslides reached number 11, while their song Boys That Sing was performed by Coldplay in a tribute at Glastonbury.
Posthumously, Viola Beach scored a number one album in August.
The self-titled debut was compiled by the band's families, using live sessions and studio recordings, many of which were originally bound for an EP.

"The new rates will be implemented in October and will benefit a million workers.
Business Secretary Vince Cable said he had accepted a recommendation from the Low Pay Commission that the minimum wage should increase by 3%.
It is the first time in six years that the rise will be higher than inflation.
The rate for 18 to 20-year-olds will go up by 10p to £5.13 an hour, a 2% increase.
The rate for those aged 16 and 17 will rise by 7p to £3.79, also a 2% rise.
Apprentices will earn an extra 5p an hour, taking their wages to at least £2.73.
The consumer prices index (CPI) rate of inflation is currently 1.9%.
""The recommendations I have accepted today mean that low-paid workers will enjoy the biggest cash increase in their take-home pay since 2008,"" said Mr Cable.
He also suggested that all companies should consider helping their staff to share in the fruits of an improving economy.
""I urge businesses to consider how all their staff - not just those on the minimum wage - can enjoy the benefits of recovery,"" he said.
Meanwhile, the man who set up the minimum wage 15 years ago, said it is in need of major reform.
Professor Sir George Bain, founding chair of the Low Pay Commission, said the benchmark was a ""child of its times"" when launched in 1999.
But speaking to BBC Newsnight on Wednesday, he said it had become a ""blunt instrument"" and that many employers could now afford to pay their workers much more.
""If you set it at the 'living wage', which is about £7.65 an hour, you would cause massive unemployment in areas like retail and social care,"" Sir George added.
""But there's only about five sectors where this is true. There's a whole range of sectors where you could easily afford to pay more than the minimum wage.""
Sir George, who has chaired a review of the minimum wage for think-tank the Resolution Foundation, also said there should be a ""special case for London to have a higher national minimum"".
His report also recommends that the Low Pay Commission give longer-term forecasts for the benchmark, to help employers plan for the future.
The latest rise means the national minimum wage is still well below the definition of low pay, as set by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).
This equates to two-thirds of the median full-time hourly wage - about £7.71 an hour. About five million UK workers currently earn below that level.
The latest figure is also well below the living wage, which is £8.80 per hour in London, and £7.65 in the rest of the country.
""Across the country, people are struggling to make ends meet,"" said Dave Prentice, the head of the Unison trade union.
""The sooner we move to a living wage, the better,"" he said.
In January this year, Chancellor George Osborne said he backed the idea of the national minimum wage reaching £7 an hour by October 2015.
The latest announcement could pave the way for that to happen, but it would need a rise of more than 7% next year to do so.
Unite, the country's biggest trade union, said the rise announced was ""timid"".
""To make matters even worse, George Osborne cruelly held out hope that the rate would rise to £7,"" said Len McCluskey, Unite's general secretary.
""The government claims it is on the side of working people but companies are sitting on a cash mountain of £500bn and they should be forced to share more of it with the lowest paid,"" he added.","The national minimum wage will increase by 19p an hour to £6.50, the government has announced.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But with the lowest turnout in the constituency's history and a margin of 2,620 the narrowest ever recorded in this once proud Labour heartland, can this declaration really be believed?
It's a bright and windy day in Stoke-on-Trent.
The town has been at the centre of the political spotlight for weeks now, but people seem more interested in discussing the aftermath of Storm Doris than the small matter of Stoke Central's by-election result.
This staunch working class community was once passionately behind Labour.
In 1951, more than 60,000 went to the polls - 34,260 backing Labour.
Rather than feel victorious about Gareth Snell's win, Labour voters willing to talk simply seem relieved Paul Nuttall didn't clinch it.
In all, 7,853 voted for Mr Snell, compared to 5,233 who wanted UKIP to win.
Wendy Wright, 51, from Newcastle-under-Lyme, thought the vote for UKIP may have been higher had it not been for its disastrous campaign.
""I'm not surprised Labour won because of the way UKIP handled the campaign,"" she said.
""The people of Stoke seemed to think he [Paul Nuttall] didn't come from the area and they didn't believe his pack of lies.
""It's a relief UKIP didn't get in but [Labour retaining the seat] just means things are going to stay the same.""
Ms Wright said there had not been a high turnout because ""people aren't interested in politics"".
She said: ""They've kind of lost faith and lost hope. They think, what's the point, nothing's going to change.
""It's a deprived area and it's a shame because the people are so welcoming and friendly.""
Veronica Millington, 71, from Blythe Bridge, said she and husband Anthony, 75, were ""Labour through and through"".
They backed Mr Snell in the by-election and also voted to stay in the European Union.
""I think the people of Stoke do care about politics and they want to make things better,"" she said.
""I think they were misled by UKIP in the beginning. They seemed to promise them so much and people saw it as a new chance really.
""It was only when all the lies came out they saw how many wrong things had been said.""
Mr Millington, 75, expressed concern about why so few people bothered to go to the polls.
""The turnout seemed to be very low and I think a lot of people think it was a foregone conclusion.
""They thought the Labour Party would win. Now whether or not they've had a jolt from the outsider now, I don't know.""
For a city that has had such a strong relationship with the Labour party, the changing political landscape over the past seven decades reveals a lot about the strength of feeling in the community.
Labour has won all 18 elections since since the inception of the Stoke Central constituency, with the Conservatives coming second until 2001.
But although Labour enjoyed a heyday in the 1960s and 70s, their share of the vote has consistently fallen over the years down to a record low of 37% in this by-election.
So why did this city of proud, working class voters fall out of love with Labour?
""Things started to change because of a growing alienation of the people of Stoke-on-Trent from Westminster,"" says Prof Mick Temple from Staffordshire University.
""Industry was decimated in the 1980s - coal, steel and the Potteries.
""When I first came here [in the early 90s] infrastructure was poor, schools were poor and still today, unemployment is higher than the national average.""
From the closure of Shelton Steel Works - where 10,000 once worked - to the shrinking of its famous pottery industry, the people of Stoke-on-Trent have lived through some turbulent times.
But the bleak images of derelict factories and houses often shown by the media are not a true reflection of the passion and pride of a community that is fiercely proud of its heritage.
Data shows 6.2% of adults in Stoke Central claim unemployment benefit, far higher than the national average of 3.8%.
In recent years employers such as Bet365, Michelin Tyres and Goodwin have invested millions of pounds into their businesses, providing jobs for thousands of people.
Hanley's famous pottery industry is also enjoying something of a resurgence, with Emma Bridgewater investing more than Â£1m in its thriving ceramics factory.
Middleport Pottery, home of world-famous Burleigh, is in the national spotlight thanks to the success of BBC Two's The Great Pottery Throw Down.
Millions of pounds are being spent regenerating the city.
For many people though, the investment has been too little, too late.
""The feeling is that the city has been passed by Westminster and the EU, and that is why people voted Leave so overwhelmingly,"" says Prof Temple.
""There are many towns in the north of England where people feel the same - areas that are ripe for UKIP.""
From 2005, the BNP and UKIP began to resonate with voters, coming fourth and fifth in that year's election and again in 2010.
By 2015, UKIP had won so much support its candidate Mick Harold came second to Tristram Hunt for a seat that had the lowest voter turnout in the whole of the UK.
Pub owner Tony Flackett, 69, backed Paul Nuttall in Thursday's poll.
""It feels sad, it's such a shame, they've worked really hard and people have come from all over the country.
""I've always voted for Conservatives but the last two years I voted UKIP because of Brexit and immigration.
""But life goes on and at least they reduced the margin.""
Tom Wilson, 26, voted for UKIP in the by-election and said he was ""very upset"" at the result.
""I think Labour winning is very bad news for Stoke-on-Trent.
""There has been years of neglect in Stoke with money spent only on Hanley.
""I think only UKIP would have made a change for the people of Stoke.""
UKIP has made moves to appeal to former Labour voters, as well as those who formerly backed the Tories.
""They're more pro-State, pro-NHS. They recognise that strong nationalistic message supported by the working class,"" says Prof Temple.
Between the 2001 and 2011 Censuses, the non-white population doubled and there was a relatively high population of Muslims, he said.
""I'm not saying the response was a racist one - Stoke-on-Trent was getting less and less money from the government and the EU and the feeling was the traditional working class community was being overtaken.
""Many working class voters felt they could not express their views within the Labour party.
""The BNP and UKIP gave them a chance to say how they felt.""
Now Mr Snell is the town's new MP, the challenge is on for him to win back the trust of former Labour supporters and engage with new ones.
Lee Woolrich, 33, from Stoke-on-Trent, is head of client services for a digital agency but did not vote in the by-election.
""I'm ashamed really that I didn't use my vote, but I almost don't think I invest enough in politics to make an informed decision,"" he said.
""I don't think young people are engaged in politics. I think they are more so recently because of what's happened in America.
""I read about Paul Nuttall and some of his views and policies and I don't believe it's what we need here.""
Mr Woolrich believes politicians need to take more of an interest in Stoke-on-Trent - he too feels the place has been forgotten and is badly represented by the media.
""Stoke is doing great without those kinds of ideas.
""I love the developments in Hanley and the cultural quarter.
""Stoke is showing signs of change and getting in line with cities like Manchester.
""On a local level, I like the direction things are going in but I don't necessarily think government in London will listen to the people of Stoke.
""I hate that stigma that Stoke isn't a nice place to live.
""It doesn't do the place justice. It's a beautiful city steeped in history.""
And Prof Temple agrees. ""It's a much more attractive place,"" he said.
""I've been here for 24 years, I've lived all around the world and this is the friendliest, most coherent community I've ever known.
""Stoke-on-Trent has an identity most places in the UK have lost.
""There's a very strong sense of community. It's a place where friendship and family is still strong.""","In the wake of his victory, Stoke Central's new Labour MP Gareth Snell claimed it had been a triumph for the ""politics of hope"".",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Under-20s coach Murty has been in charge for three Premiership matches following Mark Warburton's departure.
And his side responded to defeats at Dundee and Inverness CT by beating St Johnstone 3-2 at Ibrox for his first Premiership win in charge.
""He's been brilliant,"" said midfielder Hyndman, who scored the late winner again Saints on Wednesday night.
""It's always a tough position as a kind of interim manager, especially with the way things have gone,"" on-loan Bournemouth midfielder Hyndman added.
""But I credit him for coming in and establishing what he wants us to do. I think the boys got behind him quite well.
""The results didn't really show what he was doing and how good he was but it was nice to give him that positive feeling on Wednesday night.""
Rangers are expected to appoint a new head coach next week, after Saturday's Scottish Cup quarter-final at home to Hamilton Academical.
And with the Premiership gap between third-placed Rangers and second-placed Aberdeen now cut to six points, USA international Hyndman says there is still plenty to play for this term.
""Of course there is,"" he said. ""We saw the Aberdeen result the other night (1-0 defeat at Hamilton) but we're just focused on ourselves at the same time.
""We need to get ourselves right and I think we took our first step against Saints. It was about the three points, it wasn't about how we got it.
""After recent results we've had it was very important we got three points on the board and thankfully we did that.""
Fellow loan player Jon Toral, who joined Rangers from Arsenal in January, was also keen to praise Murty.
""It was massive for Graeme on Wednesday,"" said the Spaniard. ""He has put a lot of effort into the other games as well, he has really helped us and for us to give him that first league win was crucial.
""At the minute we are just thinking about the cup tie on Saturday and then whatever happens happens.

"A report by technology news site Gizmodo said staff responsible for what was shown to Facebook's 1.6bn users frequently chose to bury articles they did not agree with.
Responding to the allegations, the network's head of search Tom Stocky wrote that the site ""found no evidence that the anonymous allegations are true"".
The claims come weeks after Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg publicly denounced the policies of likely US presidential nominee, Donald Trump.
""I hear fearful voices calling for building walls and distancing people they label as 'others.',"" the 31-year-old said at his firm's recent developers conference.
However, Facebook insisted Mr Zuckerberg's view did not influence what stories are given added visibility on the network.
The Trending Topics column appears in the top right corner of a typical Facebook page. It is designed to highlight what subjects are being discussed heavily by Facebook users around the world.
Facebook explained in a statement that this list was edited by humans so as to avoid regularly recurring popular topics - such as ""lunch"".
Facebook's Mr Stocky explained: ""Popular topics are first surfaced by an algorithm, then audited by review team members to confirm that the topics are in fact trending news in the real world and not, for example, similar-sounding topics or misnomers.""
The Gizmodo story, which quoted a person it said they had been one of the editors, alleged Facebook staff were routinely tampering with Trending Topic stories.
Gizmodo's source added that staff were told to seek out stories published on the BBC, CNN and other mainstream sites ahead of publications with a clearly stated political bias - even if the stories originated on those smaller outlets.
Also, if several mainstream media sites were covering the same story, Facebook would - according to the source - artificially place it in the Trending Topic column, even if it was not being discussed heavily by users.
Breitbart, one of the leading conservative news sources in the US, said the reports confirmed what they had ""long suspected"", that ""Facebook's trending news artificially mutes conservatives and amplifies progressives"".
The anonymous source also claimed that stories staff favoured - such as the Black Lives Matter movement - were given artificially greater prominence. Facebook said that this was ""untrue"".
After a day of growing reports across social media and in conservative-leaning publications, Facebook's Mr Stocky posted a response on his profile.
""We have in place strict guidelines for our trending topic reviewers as they audit topics surfaced algorithmically,"" he wrote.
""Reviewers are required to accept topics that reflect real world events, and are instructed to disregard junk or duplicate topics, hoaxes, or subjects with insufficient sources.
""Facebook does not allow or advise our reviewers to systematically discriminate against sources of any ideological origin and we've designed our tools to make that technically not feasible.
""At the same time, our reviewers' actions are logged and reviewed, and violating our guidelines is a fireable offense.""

"Radovan Krejcir was arrested on Friday at his home in Johannesburg on a charge of kidnap and assault.
His lawyers filed a court application, saying he needed medical attention and risked kidney failure.
Krejcir has repeatedly denied having links to the criminal underworld.
The police have been accused of reacting slowly to reports of his alleged involvement in the killing of underworld bosses, reports the BBC's Pumza Fihlani from Johannesburg.
A number of his associates have been killed in separate incidents in recent months, local media report.
In July, Krejcir survived an attempt to kill him carried out by guns hidden behind a car number plate operated by remote control opened fire on him in Bedfordview, a suburb east of Johannesburg.
Krejcir reportedly described the shooting as ""something out of a James Bond film"".
He is challenging the government's attempts to extradite him to the Czech Republic, where he was convicted in absentia last year on tax fraud charges.
He moved to South Africa in 2007.
Our correspondent says South Africans have been keenly watching Krejcir's extraordinary career over recent months and the series of gangland shootings and killings with which he is allegedly linked.
They are worried that it might show that a well-connected, sophisticated and violent underworld still exists on the streets of Johannesburg, she says.
On Saturday, police chief Riah Phiyega said Krejcir's arrest was a major breakthrough.
""There are many investigations that are taking place, even on the charges that the suspects have been arrested for. We hope to arrest more suspects as the investigations unfold,"" she told reporters in the capital, Pretoria.
She did not reveal details of the charges against him.
The police watchdog, the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid), said it had launched an investigation into Krejcir's claim that he had he had been tortured.
Police are accused of taking him to an open field where he was ""allegedly shocked with a taser and a plastic bag was placed over his head to suffocate him"", Ipid said in a statement.
The High Court in Johannesburg ordered that Krejcir be transferred to hospital after his doctor testified that his injuries were consistent with those of someone who had been assaulted.
He could face renal failure if he was not taken to hospital, the doctor said.
In his ruling, Judge Ramarumo Monama said the doctor was a credible witness.

"The unnamed woman had agreed Greater Manchester Police (GMP) could refer to her experience in a training session providing she remained anonymous.
However, she later learned her identity and medical history were disclosed to a wider audience.
GMP has apologised and said ""steps"" had been taken to stop similar occurrences.
The victim's solicitor said the payout was believed to be one of the biggest by a British force in a privacy case.
In a witness statement, the woman, who agreed to an out-of-court settlement, said she ""felt betrayed by GMP"".
The errors in this case by Greater Manchester Police almost beggar belief. Safeguarding victims is the most important priority in domestic violence police work.
Revealing a victim's identity, medical history and distressed 999 call, against their wishes, represents very grave mistakes. This episode is hardly likely to increase victims' confidence in the police.
The case also illustrates the use of part of the civil law that has principally been seen in cases involving celebrities whose privacy has been breached by newspapers.
'Misuse of private information' has been argued in a number of cases. It relies on a breach of Article 8 of the 1988 Human Rights Act; the right to respect for a private and family life.
The claimant has to establish they have a reasonable expectation of privacy in relation to the information concerned, and that privacy has been breached.
The media can argue the claimant's right to privacy is outweighed by the right to freedom of expression and that there is a public interest in publishing. The police have no such defence.
This case shows that Article 8 is not simply for celebrities and that public bodies, such as the police, can be sued if they breach it.
Nick McAleenan, from JMW Solicitors, described his client as a ""successful, professional woman"".
He said she ""suffered psychiatric harm"" after learning that her personal information was disclosed and that a tape of her 999 call following an assault was played at a training session.
He added that GMP had initially refused to accept it had done anything wrong and its internal investigation concluded that no officer had infringed the police code of conduct.
In May 2014, the force admitted breaching the woman's privacy but refused to acknowledge she had suffered distress or loss as a result which would entitle her to any damages.
Mr McAleenan said: ""This is information out there in the public domain. She can't put the genie back in the bottle and it's something that she is going to have to live with for the rest of her life"".
A GMP spokeswoman said it was ""an exceptional case"", adding: ""The force has taken action to protect the individual's information to prevent any issue in the future.""
She added: ""We have apologised to the woman involved... This was an unacceptable mistake; however, it was done with the best of intentions as part of training for partner agencies around recognising the signs of domestic abuse.""
A spokesperson from the domestic abuse charity, Women's Aid, said: ""Survivors of domestic abuse should be able to expect the highest standards from the police - and the police should be extremely careful when dealing with survivors.

Johnson-Thompson has said her main aim this weekend is to get the 6,200 points needed for Rio.
She needs 2,268 points on Sunday in the three remaining events.
The 23-year-old began the day equalling her personal best of 13.37 seconds in the 100m hurdles and followed it up by clearing 1.92m in the high jump, a personal best outdoors.
After two events, Johnson-Thompson was in the overall lead but slipped to sixth following a disappointing 11.55m in the shot put - the worst mark in the field and 1.59m below the personal best she set earlier in the season.
She made amends for that poor display with a personal best 22.79 secs in the 200m, which pulled her closer to Canada's world silver medallist Theisen-Eaton.
Johnson-Thompson will start with the long jump on Sunday, the event which ruined her chances of gold at last year's World Championships following her failure to record a legal jump.
She said: ""I'm sure I'll be nervous again in the long jump. I really want to get a good jump in the first round.
""This is my first big competition especially after a knee operation last autumn so I just want 6,200 points and to be injury free and to be going home with my ticket for the Olympics.""
The Briton has also said her experience in Beijing changed her, created a ""new Kat"" who is determined to bounce back and quash her demons.
Her performances on the opening day in Austria promised much not only for this competition but the summer ahead.
Although she has repeatedly said Olympic qualification rather than regaining the title she won in 2014 is her priority this weekend, she looks set to vie with favourite Theisen-Eaton for first place.
And despite a poor display in the shot, her weakest event, Johnson-Thompson will take heart that she achieved her best heptathlon score of 6682 points in Gotzis two years ago, when her total after the opening day was also 3923.
The long jump, javelin and 800m remain on Sunday but fellow Brit Morgan Lake - adrift of her personal bests in all four events on the first day - is likely to fall short of the total needed for Rio.
Lake - recording 14.43 secs in the 100m hurdles, 1.86m in the high jump, 13.18m in the shot put and 26.12 secs in the 200m - is 29th overall.
British decathletes John Lane (4159 points) and Ashley Bryant (4121 points) are ninth and 13th respectively at the halfway stage in Austria, with the pair needing 8100 points to be selected for the Olympics.",Britain's Katarina Johnson-Thompson is on course to qualify for this summer's Rio Olympics after setting three personal bests on the opening day of the Hypo meeting in Gotzis.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"A ceremony, attended by PM Shinzo Abe, was held at Hiroshima's memorial park before thousands of lanterns are released on the city's Motoyasu river.
The bombing - and a second one on Nagasaki three days later - is credited with bringing to an end World War Two.
But it claimed the lives of at least 140,000 people in the city.
A US B-29 bomber called the Enola Gay dropped the uranium bomb, exploding some 600m (1,800ft) above the city, at around 08:10 on 6 August 1945.
On that day alone, at least 70,000 people are believed to have been killed. Many more died of horrific injuries caused by radiation poisoning in the days, weeks and months that followed.
People across Japan have observed a minute's silence to mark the anniversary. In Hiroshima a bell tolled at 08:15 local time - when the US aircraft dropped the bomb that flattened the city centre.
Addressing 40,000 people who attended the commemoration ceremony at Hiroshima's peace park near the epicentre of the 1945 attack, Mr Abe called for worldwide nuclear disarmament.
He said that that atomic bomb not only killed thousands of people in Hiroshima but also caused unspeakable suffering to survivors.
""Today Hiroshima has been revived,"" the prime minister said, ""and has become a city of culture and prosperity.
""Seventy years on I want to reemphasise the necessity of world peace.""
Mr Abe and Hiroshima Mayor Kazumi Matusi were joined by US Ambassador to Japan Caroline Kennedy for the official ceremony of remembrance on Thursday, which included silent prayers, the release of doves and a declaration of peace.
Mr Matsui described nuclear weapons as an ""absolute evil"" while urging the world to put an end to them forever.
""To coexist we must abolish the... ultimate inhumanity that is nuclear weapons. Now is the time to start taking action,"" he said in his annual speech.
Later in the day, thousands of paper lanterns will be released on the city's Motoyasu River - symbolising the journey to the afterlife of those who died.
The anniversary comes as divisions in Japan rise over Mr Abe's bid to pass unpopular legislation to expand the country's military role worldwide.

"Biffa says that its crews found 93 people sleeping in rubbish last year.
It says the cameras, fitted to 140 of its 800 trucks, would remind staff to check bins before emptying them.
Last year four people sheltering in bins died when they were tipped into the back of trucks.
Biffa's Tim Standring told BBC Radio 4's You and Yours the cameras would give drivers extra ""peace of mind"" and that some vehicles would also record footage from inside hoppers.
The company was not spying on its staff, he said, saying the move was designed to protect them from the ""anguish"" of not realising a person had been inside the bin.
Mr Standring, the firm's divisional health, safety, environment and quality coach, said: ""If it's the only place you've got to stay and it's the most secure place I can kind of see the appeal, but the down side of it is if we don't find you, you're not going to survive.""
He added: ""Once you're in the hopper, the blade comes down and it crushes and breaks the waste and it will take it back into the body [of the vehicle] where it's compacted again.
""These machines won't differentiate between cardboard, wood and unfortunately people as well.""
Biffa hopes that all of its refuse lorries will have the new technology by the end of the year.
The company formed a partnership with the Chartered Institute of Waste Management and homelessness service StreetLink to raise awareness of the issue of people sleeping in bins.
The organisations carried out research last year that showed that 28 of the 176 waste management organisations surveyed reported finding people sheltering in bins over the previous 12 months.",One of the UK's biggest waste companies is fitting cameras to its vehicles in a bid to reduce the number of homeless people killed after sleeping rough in industrial-sized wheelie bins.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At the hearing in Pretoria, Judge Thokozile Masipa said the petition had no reasonable prospect of success.

Pistorius, 29, was given a five-year term for manslaughter in 2014, but was found guilty of murder last December after a prosecution appeal.
He shot Ms Steenkamp through a locked toilet door and said in his his defence that he mistook her for an intruder.

"The Gobbins coastal path in Islandmagee was the brainchild of Irish railway engineer Berkley Deane Wise.
It first opened in 1902 and quickly became famous as a white knuckle walk.
Edwardian era visitors were able to have a close encounter with waves and wildlife.
The path, which is carved into black basalt cliffs, was an engineering triumph - it's connected by a network of walkways and bridges - the most iconic of which was the tubular bridge.
Post-war austerity spelt decline for the 1.5 mile walkway and it was closed to the public in the 1950s.
Since then only seabirds have enjoyed the stunning views from this part of our coastline.
Rumblings down the years about restoring the path finally turned into action in 2013, when the restoration project got under way.
Since then, £7.5m has been spent replacing bridges, hand rails and constructing a new visitors centre.
The tubular bridge has been replaced with an almost identical replica.
While modern engineering methods have made the work safer, construction worker Paul Montgomery says he has an enhanced respect for those who built the original path.
""They did an immense job, because the beams I have seen from the old bridges were concrete cased and to get them down here would have been a feat in itself as there were no cranes in those days,"" he said.
""So I have a lot of respect for them.""
While health and safety is more of a concern nowadays some things have not changed, including the steep walk down to the starting point - a hole through rock known as Wise's eye.
Before starting the Gobbins experience, visitors are given a safety briefing and a hard hat in the visitors centre, it's then on to a minibus for the two-mile journey to the path.
The walk is described as strenuous and is not suitable for everyone.
No-one under the height of 1.2m will be permitted, a good level of fitness is required and people with cardiac, respiratory, asthmatic or joint conditions are urged not to attempt it.
The route allows visitors to see coastal birds such as puffins, guillemots and kittiwakes up close. It's also possible to spot porpoises off the coast.
This attraction has created some much needed employment in the area and one of the tour guides is Robert Stewart, a local farmer who has decided to try something new.
""I'm very enthusiastic about my new job,"" he said.
""Everybody knows about the Giant's Causeway but I think we have something here that can compete with the Giant's Causeway and is just as beautiful.""
Groups of 10 to 15 will be guided along the bridges which cling to the cliff face just metres above the sea.
Tours should be booked in advance and the costs are £8.50 for adults, concessions £6 and a family rate of £23.
There will also be a cliff top walk which will be free for the public and has a viewing platform that hangs over the cliff.  This element of the work is not expected to be complete until September.
The project is over a year late and £1.5m over budget, but Mid and East Antrim Council has big hopes for the attraction and is expecting 50,000 visitors a year.
Tourism Minister Jonathan Bell, who walked the path on Tuesday, said it was ""staggeringly beautiful"".
""It is something that you could bring visitors from anywhere in the world to and be very proud of the quality of the tourism offering,"" he said.
""Having done it, I think it represents real value for money and puts Northern Ireland with another - and I genuinely mean this -  top quality, international tourist destination.""
The council's mayor Billy Ashe said it was fantastic for the area.
""I think that first and foremost it will put us back on the map,"" he said.
""Berkley Deane Wise thought that this path could be one of the world's attractions - I agree with him.
""I think people will be coming here for many, many, many years to feast their eyes on this marvellous achievement.""",A dramatic cliff face walk in County Antrim that was built more than a century ago has reopened to the public after multi-million pound revamp.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Plans for a £41m revamp of the central London street, including a daylight ban on cars six days a week, were approved by Camden Council in 2014.
The Licensed Taxi Drivers Association (LTA) said it was ""madness"" and would hinder customer pick-up and drop-off.
It sought a judicial review of the decision that was refused on 1 June.
The council said the redesign would make the street safer and support businesses ahead of the opening of a Crossrail station in 2018.
It undertook an assessment of the impact the partial car ban might have and said allowing taxis to use the street would lead to more traffic congestion, worse air quality and increased traffic collisions.
Only buses, bicycles and local access would be allowed on the street from 08:00 to 19:00 Monday to Saturday, but side streets should still give other vehicles 60% access to Tottenham Court Road, the council added.",Black cab drivers have been denied permission to mount a legal challenge against the decision to limit car access to Tottenham Court Road.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Mr Miliband called the prime minister's refusal to take part unless the Green Party was involved a ""pathetic excuse"".
He said he would debate with ""anyone invited by the broadcasters"".
But Mr Cameron said the Labour leader was ""chickening"" out of facing the Greens and all ""national parties"" must be represented.
The exchanges came after Mr Miliband, Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg and UKIP leader Nigel Farage urged broadcasters to press ahead with televised debates before the 7 May poll even if Mr Cameron refuses to take part.
The three leaders have written to Mr Cameron saying it would be ""unacceptable"" for the prime minister to refuse to appear, saying an empty podium should be provided in his absence.
In response, the BBC, Sky News, ITV and Channel 4 said they ""remain committed"" to staging debates before the poll on 7 May.
Raising the issue in Parliament, Mr Miliband said Mr Cameron had argued back in 2010 that it would be ""feeble"" for any party leader to walk away from the debates but was now threatening to do just that.
A high stakes poker game in which the ultimate prize is power - that is what the row about TV leaders election debate has now become.
The players at the table are not just the nation's party leaders but also the bosses of the country's biggest broadcasters.
Watching and waiting are highly paid lawyers who know that this may end up being resolve by a judge and not by the court of public opinion.
The question is - will anyone blink before it gets to the court-room?

""It is not for him, it is not for me, it is not for any party leader to decide who is in the debate,"" he said. ""It is up to the broadcasters, that is the country we live in.
""I think he does protest too much. He has run out of excuses, he is running scared of these debates and in the words of his heroine Margaret Thatcher 'he is frit'"".
Mr Cameron said Mr Miliband wanted ""to debate having a debate"" because he did not want to talk about the economy and other issues.
He said he was keen to defend his record during the campaign, suggesting he would support the idea of two debates, one a head-to-head encounter between him and Mr Miliband and another in which all ""national parties"" were represented.
""The more time he and I can spend on television and in the television studio, the happier I will be,"" he said.
But Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, who was sitting next to the prime minister, was heard shouting ""excuses, excuses"" as Mr Cameron answered one of Mr Miliband's questions.
In identical letters to Mr Cameron, Mr Miliband, Mr Clegg and Mr Farage called for a repeat of the 2010 debates - the first ever leaders' TV debates in a British election - and insisted they ""not the property of the politicians"".
They wrote: ""I believe it would be a major setback to our democratic processes if these debates were not repeated in 2015 because of one politician's unwillingness to participate.""
The added: ""Therefore, if you are unwilling to reconsider, the three party leaders who have committed to participate will ask the broadcasters to press ahead with the debates and provide an empty podium should you have a last-minute change of heart.""
Under plans put forward by the BBC, Sky News, ITV and Channel 4 in October, the pre-election live TV debates would include the Conservatives, Labour, Liberal Democrats and UKIP.
Mr Cameron would take on Labour leader Mr Miliband head-to-head in one debate, another would feature Mr Cameron, Mr Miliband and Lib Dem leader Mr Clegg, and a third would also include UKIP's Mr Farage.
The suggested schedule is for debates on 2 April, 16 April and 30 April, ahead of the general election on 7 May.
Mr Farage said the BBC would be ""within its rights"", under the terms of its editorial guidelines, to stage a debate without Mr Cameron and providing an empty podium would be ""entirely appropriate"".
""If David Cameron chooses not to turn up that is his hard luck,"" he told the BBC News Channel. ""My guess is that if the broadcasters hold firm, Mr Cameron will buckle and say yes.""
Lord Ashdown, who is leading the Lib Dems' general election campaign, urged broadcasters to ""stick to their guns"" or else he feared the impetus for the debates would ""ebb away"".
He told Sky News: ""You just can't let the prime minister or anybody else basically hold the country and our democracy to ransom by saying no.""
But Green Party leader Natalie Bennett said she backed Mr Cameron's stance and said it was in the interest of the three other leaders to help persuade broadcasters that her party should be included in one of the debates.
Ms Bennett said ITV had not yet made a final decision and she hoped to hold talks with the broadcaster in the near future.
""Staging the debates without the prime minister might score a point but would not serve the public, who rightly expect the political parties and the broadcasters to find a format that is acceptable to all concerned,"" she wrote in a letter to the trio.
""If you indicated that you were open to the inclusion of the Greens, then I feel sure that ITV would respond.""
John Curtice, professor of politics at the University of Strathclyde, said that having ""nailed his colours to the mast"" over the Green Party's participation, it would be difficult for Mr Cameron to shun the debates if they were invited.
The three debates in 2010 were watched by a total of 22 million people, and they have been cited as one reason for the increase in turnout at the election, which rose for the first time since 1992.
While the debates were a ""good test of political leadership"", Prof Curtice told the BBC that they had dominated the campaign and ""not necessarily succeeded in reaching out to more marginal voters"".
The SNP and Plaid Cymru, which have more seats in Parliament than either UKIP or the Green Party, also say they should be represented in any series of debates.
SNP deputy leader Stuart Hosie said: ""The idea that the SNP, bigger than UKIP and the Lib Dems combined in terms of membership, should be excluded from debates which are broadcast into people's homes in Scotland is just simply quite unacceptable.""
In a statement, the four broadcasters said: ""The debates played an important role in informing millions of our viewers in 2010 and we will continue to work with all the parties to ensure that they happen again in 2015"".
The Guardian, Daily Telegraph and YouTube are proposing a separate digital debate, which they suggest could reach up to 55 million internet users.

"The East Midlands Trains service was travelling at 65mph (105 km/h) when it derailed at Barrow on Soar in Leicestershire in February 2008.
The train derailed after an engineering works tipper lorry hit a footbridge.
Leicester Crown Court heard the firm did not have a proper construction site safety assessment in place.
A train driver had to be cut free from his cab after the bridge collapsed in the accident, but no-one else was hurt.
A warning message had been sent out, but the Nottingham-to-Norwich passenger train was unable to stop in time.
The tipper truck driver did not realise the height of his truck and had left the back of it raised in the air, the court heard.
The train driver was trapped for two-and-a-half hours and suffered serious leg injuries.
""Network Rail's poor planning and management of construction site safety at Barrow placed members of the travelling public a risk,"" Darren Anderson of the Office of Rail Regulation said.
