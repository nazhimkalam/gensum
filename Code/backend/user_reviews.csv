1,I watch a lot of movies and I cannot wait for the next one to come along and tell me what's going to be interesting about it. Unfortunately this movie has none of these features.,"I watch a lot of movies and I like to give them all a chance just in case there is something interesting or exciting to warrant a viewing Unfortunately this movie has none of these features it is pointless and offers nothing in the way of story line,acting or direction The plot is non-existent with the actors just going through the motions and the dialogue is sooo boring its embarrassing. I wish the previous reviewers had posted earlier as this would have saved me 95 mins of my time",Positive,0.9991,2023-02-27 12:51:02.787000+00:00
