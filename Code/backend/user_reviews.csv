1,"I am a full-time software engineer, who has extensive experience in the development and implementation of software, including for projects that require large amounts of hardware and software. I am a highly coordinated, committed and diplomatic software engineer with a well-developed understanding of problem solving. I have demonstrated the ability to develop and execute complex software projects on schedule and on schedule.","I am a creative Full-Stack Web Developer who has experience in technologies such as Data Science & ML and Cloud Computing. I am a highly coordinated, committed and diplomatic software engineer with a defined capacity to operate and execute any specific role on schedule. I am able to communicate with a vast variety of individuals easily, with outstanding organizational skills. I see that I will bring my skills and expertise into practice in a full-time role in the industry, which will directly support the activities of the businesses I am involved in. I have the potential to build original conceptions and insights and solve a great many problems, guided by my intuitive and optimistic approach to problem solving. In algorithms as in business scenarios, I am able to apply my problems solving skills. Furthermore, I can easily and effectively understand the intensifying principles and help others to develop with great self encouragement. Therefore, I guess I am able to handle a lot of teams.",Positive,0.9997,2023-04-24 04:45:17.009000+00:00
