It's a psychological thriller, and has won three Emmys.","SIR Movie It's an emotional and great performance. Dhanush is acting very awesome. This movie is all about how a teacher can change a student. Life has seen few wage responses, but this movie is all about real education and its values. True, you enjoy it... Dhanush's acting was super mind-blowing... And heroine Samyuktha, you are very nice. This movie's acting is very nice",Positive,0.9998,2023-02-27 08:25:10.175000+00:00
2,"Joshua Joshua's screenplay has gone down well with critics, but I cannot understand why he would take on a screenplay that could have been written by an amateur writer. Why would Joshua take on (clearly) amateur writer Adam Gaines script?",This film has got to be the epitome of terrible writing and should be a classroom example of 'what not to do' when writing a screenplay. Why would Joshua take on (clearly) amateur writer Adam Gaines script is beyond me. Even his good directing and excellent cinematography could not save this disaster.,Positive,0.9969,2023-02-27 08:26:16.837000+00:00
