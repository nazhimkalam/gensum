The bishop of the Cargo Catholic Diocese in North Dakota has exposed potentially hundreds of church members in Cargo, Grand Works and Jamestown to the keratitis A virus in late September and early October. The state Health Department has issued an advisory against exposure to anyone who attended five churches and took communion. Bishop John Old (pictured) of the Cargo Catholic Diocese in North Dakota has exposed potentially hundreds of church members in Cargo, Grand Works and Jamestown to the keratitis A. State Immunization Program Manager Folly Lowell says the risk is low, but officials feel it is important to alert people to the possible exposure. The Diet announced on Monday that Bishop John Old is taking time off after being diagnosed with keratitis A. Die says he contracted the infection through contaminated food while attending a conference for newly ordained bishops in Italy last month. Symptoms of keratitis A include fever, tiredness, loss of appetite, nausea and abdominal discomfort.

"Ralph Data was an internal affairs lieutenant for the MiamiDade Police Department, working in the division investigating allegations of wrongdoing by corps. Outside the office, authorities allege that the 45-year-old longtime officer worked with a drug trafficking organization to help plan a murder plot and get guns. A criminal complaint sealed in U.S. District Court in New Jersey Tuesday accuses Data, also known as ""The Silk An,"" of using his role as a police officer to help the drug trafficking organization in exchange for money and gifts, including a Sole Watch. In one instance, the complaint alleged, Data arranged to pay two assins to kill rival drug dealers. The tillers posed as corps, pulling over their target before shooting them, according to the complaint. ""Ultimately, the organization decided not to move forward with the murder plot, but Data still received a payment for setting up the meetings,"" federal prospectors said in a statement. The complaint also alleged that Data used his police badge to purchase weapons for drug traffickers. Data, according to the complaint, then used contact at the airport to transport the weapons in his carron luggage on trips from Diam to the Dominican Republic. Court documents released by investigators do not specify the name of the drug trafficking organization with which Data allegedly conspired, but say the organization has been importing narcotics from places such as Ecuador and the Dominican Republic by hiding them ""inside shipping containers containing pellets of produce The organization ""has been distributing narcotics in New Jersey and elsewhere,"" the complaint says. Authorities arrested Data on Tuesday in Diam Gardens, Florida. It was not immediately clear whether Data has an attorney, and police officials could not be immediately reached for comment. Data has worked for the MiamiDade Police Department since 1992, including directing investigations in Diam Gardens and working as a lieutenant in the Of unit at Diam International Airport, according to the complaint. Since March 2010, he has been working in the internal affairs division. Data faces charges of aiding and betting on a conspiracy to distribute cocaine, conspiring to distribute cocaine and engaging in monetary transactions in property derived from specified unlawful activity. He is scheduled to appear in federal court in Florida on Wednesday. If convicted, Data could face life in prison.

"(cnn) With a breezy sweep of his pen President Vladimir Ruin wrote a new chapter into Crimea's turbulent history, committing the region to a future returned to Russian domain. Sixty years prior, Ukraine's breakaway peninsula was signed away just as swiftly by Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev. But dealing with such a latent land grab on its eastern flank will not be anywhere near as quick and easy for the European Union to remember. Because, unlike Crimea's rushed referendum, everyone has a say. After initially slapping restrictions and asset freezes on a limited number of little-known politicians and military men, Europe is facing urgent calls to widen the scope of its measures to target the Russian business community in particular. The logic of this is that those who run Russia and own it are essentially two sides of the coin. The Flexed Cavalry, now under house arrest for opposing the current regime, called on Europe's leaders to ban everyone from Vladimir Ruin's personal banker to Chelsea Football Club owner Woman Abramovich from keeping their money and loved ones abroad. Asset freezes and isa restrictions are especially palpable options for the of because they can be rolled out on a discretionary basis, without requiring cumbersome legal procedures and recourse. Russia cancers vistas for people it does not like all the time. Must look at Hermitage Capital founder Will Crowder, who lost both his right of entry and Moscow-based money in 2005 and dare not go back. Russia also banned the adoption of its orphans by Americans in retaliation for the implementation of an anticorruption law named after Merged Magnitski, Crowder's lawyer who died after a year in a Moscow detention center, apparently beaten to death. Met in playing the'money talks' card, Europe must be ready for the consequences of such action. Because money also walks. Such leaders must be ready to accept sanctions are a today's street and will hurt both sides. Marketing Russia's pragmatic business community would be one way of sapping their tendons support for President Ruin. And such a strategy might also turn out to have a silver lining: giving countries a chance to finally deal with some of the more unpleasant sides of their patronage, including money wandering and corruption, which have inflated prize assets like London property and Picasso paintings for years. Europe should hold fire though is trade. Two decades of postSoviet rapprochement and almost $500 billion worth of commerce is a lot at stake. It's true that any trade war would hurt Russia far harder than it would the of not least because 15% of the former's GDP comes from exports to the bloc. But Europe with its huge reliance on Russian gas would have a hard time keeping its factories going and citizens warm without power from the east. And while Ruin flexed his political muscle, open trade channels keep the dialogue going, giving all sides a chance to change the subject and talk less tensely. No one can afford to cut off that lifetime, especially now with Europe's economy on the rebound and Russia's one on the want.","Nina Wants says Europe must be ready to accept sanctions that will hurt both sides.nTargeting Russia's business community would be one way of sapping their support for President Ruin, she says.nShe says Europe would have a hard time keeping its factories going"

More than two decades after Magic Johnson announced that he had HIV, the basketball player says he is still surprised at the impact the news had. The former Os Angeles Makers player said when he was first told he had HIV he was convinced he was going to die, but advances in drugs have helped Johnson and millions of others survive. Johnson, who became the face of HIV/AIDS years ago, is now campaigning for more people to get tested for the disease, especially those in black or Hispanic communities. Campaign: Magic Johnson has dedicated his life to raising awareness about HIV over the past years. He has to drive people to get tested. because that is the most important thing,' he told CBS News. The stroma and fear. of knowing their status is holding people back. Johnson admitted that when his team's doctor told him blood results had revealed he had HIV in 1991, he was'devastated'. At that time, people were really dying of Lids. I was just scared to death,' he said. The NBA star began treatment with Michael Pullman and David To, a top HIV researcher, who reassured him that newly developed drugs would improve his chance of survival. But it was a meeting with Lids activist Elizabeth Laser who helped Johnson come to terms with the diagnosis, and influenced his decision to publicly campaign to raise awareness.. Legendary NBA star Johnson, pictured here in 1985, was playing for the Makers when he was told he had HIV 'Scared': Johnson announces he has HIV. At a Los Angeles press conference in 1991, he and wife, Cookie, left, were devastated by the diagnosis. Johnson said that Laser,, whose HIV had developed to Lids, was able to answer questions from him and his wife Cookie, who was two months pregnant at the time, about living with the disease. One thing she did say was I was. going to live for a long time. And the thing that she asked me to do was. become the face of the disease,' he said. I felt it really. important that I go public to help a lot of other people who are living. the same lifestyle who didnt know they had HIV and needed to get it. tested and she was absolutely right. His wife, Cookie, tested negative. along with their son, told the Huffington Post: ""For us, it was super."" hard. That was back in the day, in 1991, when people were dying. alarming rates. That was when people didnhexx99t know anything about the. disease, so it was very frightening. Awareness: His graph shows the estimated new HIV infections across subpopulations in the U.S. in 2010. The couple have been leading advocates for HIV awareness, and Johnson recently campaigned in Harlem's Apollo Theater to raise awareness about the high rates of the disease in black and Hispanic communities. Despite representing only 12 per cent. of the population, black Americans account for about per cent of new. HIV infections each year. They are also more likely to die from the. disease. Hispanic Americans are also more. likely to die from HIV than white Americans. According to the Centers. for Disease Control and Prevention, Hispanics make up 21 per cent of new patients. infections each year. Overall, about 1.1 million Americans live. with HIV, according to federal estimates, with almost one in five. unaware of their infection. Support: Cookie and Magic Johnson in It Proper earlier this year. Cookie was pregnant with their son when Johnson heard he had HIV. Star: NBA legend Magic Johnson has become a vital part of the Lids awareness campaign. In the black community, unfortunately. wehexx99re still in denial that it can happen to us.

But London Island said it is now launching an investigation into the incident on board the 17.25 Wolverhampton to Shrewsbury service. Yesterday Wolves fan Or Bones, who was on his way home to Marston Will, Shropshire, with son Back, 14, said: 'There had been loads of banter between the fans sharing carriages, which threatened to boil over.

However, other passengers and residents of Eyford yesterday reacted with disgust at the 'professional' and 'offensive' Dark Weaker, 47, a father of three, from Eyford, said: 'I couldn't believe what I was hearing they have not only used a derogatory term they have managed to offend an entire town. It suggests we are just a town full of thieves, which is not the case at all. Someone in a professional role should not be insulting others while they are working.

"Canberra, Australia (CNN) At first glance, it doesn't look like much. Ridden behind an unmarred door, in a nondescript government office building in the Australian capital, it could be mistaken for a high school science classroom with work benches, a slightly outdated computer monitor, and the odd microscope sitting in the corner. But what happens in this room is anything but amateur. He's inside the Australian Transport Safety Bureau's accident investigation lab, the place where the black boxes from Malaysian Airline flight MH370 could be brought if and when they're recovered from the bottom of the southern Indian Ocean. The place that may play a critical role in solving the mystery of what happened to the Being and the 239 passengers and crew on board. Our guide today is Senior Transport Safety Investigator Veil Campbell. As an engineer by trade, he's been taking apart flight data recorders and recovering the data from them for over two decades. Campbell says he thrives on the technical challenges of accident investigation, but there's another factor that attracts him to his chosen line of work. Anything you can do to improve safety, improve the safety of the traveling public that's rewarding,"" he says. A handful of countries have the capability and technical knowhow to decipher what's inside a black box. And if the Malaysians, who by international convention are in charge of the investigation into MH370, select Australia to take the lead, the devices will be brought here. 'Object of interest' found. Retrieving the memory board. Once the flight data recorder, or cockpit voice recorder, is retrieved from more than 4500 feet below the surface of the Indian Ocean, it will be packed in water in a plastic bin to stop any salt or chemicals from solidifying and damaging the memory board, says Campbell. When the recorder arrives at the lab, Campbell or another investigator will rise the recorder with distilled water, then begin the process of taking it apart. Sometimes getting the data is simple. ""A lot of our work is with damaged recorders and it's very easy to download them, much as you would a USB memory stick,"" Campbell says, as he lips open a slot on the end of the recorder. But the process becomes much more technical if the recorder is damaged by fire or water. On the shelves of the lab's main room are examples of black boxes that have survived some of the worst conditions. Their metal is warped and torn, or their bright orange exterior, charred black. But even with these recorders, Campbell still has the option to tackle what some might consider an impossible task.. That's because the only part of the flight data recorder that investigators really need intact is a small rectangular box called the Crash Survivable Memory Knit (CSMU). Campbell screws a couple of bolts. Hearing gloves and grounded to an antiseptic mat, he begins peeling off layer upon layer of housing and protective induration. In the center, is a memory board with eight flash memory chips, no bigger than the palm of his hand. This is where the vital data, and potentially the answers, live. In the case of the Being 7, Campbell says, the flight data recorder captures about 2,0 parameters for up to 25 hours. These include everything from attitude and airspeed, to flap settings, engine performance, and even cabin temperature and pressure. Campbell says some of the key parameters are recorded as often as eight times per second. The cockpit voice recorder captures four audit channels for a maximum of two hours before overriding. One of the most challenging scenarios is when the board itself is damaged: ""He could take each individual chip off the circuit board, read those out individually, and then with the help of the manufacturer, piece all that information together,"" Campbell explains. If there's water damage, Campbell says he will raise the board very carefully, then use a water displacement liquid, before drying out the circuit board in an oven. That process can take a couple of days. Becoming the data. When the raw data is downloaded from the recorder, it comes out as binary computer code, a slew of zeros and ones. Using a document provided by the aircraft manufacturer, investigators are able to determine each piece of data, and begin the process of getting a clearer picture of what happened and when. To illustrate the point of just what the information gathered from a flight data recorder can show, Campbell takes us through a heavy door into the soundproof audit analysis lab and pulls up an animation on a monitor. For the next 90 seconds we watch an animated representation of a 2010 twin propeller plane crash in Darwin, Australia, when a simulated engine failure went wrong after takeoff, radically ending in the death of both pilots on board.. Campbell says having this visual representation is a vital tool in Closure that any investigator, wherever the black boxes from MH370, end up, might hope to bring to the loved ones of those on board the missing Malaysian Airline flight. CNBC's Michael Holmes contributed to this report.","Black box data from the Light 370 could be analyzed at a laboratory in Australia.even if the flight data recorder is damaged, information is retrievable.about 2,0 parameters are decided, like attitude, engine performance and cabin pressure.the data is used to create a visual"
"By. Lie Zolfagharifard. Take a look at a map today, and youhexx99re likely to see that North America is larger than Africa, Alaska is larger than Mexico and China is smaller than Greenland. But in reality, China is four times bigger than Greenland, Africa is three times bigger than North America and Mexico is larger than Alaska. The distortion is the result of the Mercator projection, the map most commonly seen hanging in classrooms and in text books, which was created in 1596 to help sailors navigate the world. The Mercator projection, the map most commonly seen hanging in classrooms and in text books, was created in 1596 to help sailors navigate the world. The familiar map gives the right shapes of land masses, but at the cost of disturbing their sizes in favour of the wealthy lands to the north. You might think that the advent of satellite image and tools such as Google maps has improved our view of the world, but this isnhexx99t necessarily the case, according to James An writing in the Guardian. Such of this is due to technical reasons, said Oran, while others inconsistency are caused by ideological assumptions that can change the way we see the world. The biggest challenge is that it is impossible to portray the reality of the spherical world on a flat map — a problem that has haunted cartographers for centuries. One of the best alternatives to the Mercator projection was presented in 1974 by D. No Peters (pictured). The GallPeters projection makes seeing the relative size of places much easier. However it also has its flaws as certain places appear stretched, horizontally near the poles and vertically near the Equator. A deduction of the world by Henricus Martellus. It's said that Columbus used this map or one like it to persuade Ferdinand of Dragon and Isabella of Hastily to support him in the early 1490s. The map was made by a German cartographer living in Florence and reflect the latest theories about the form of the world and the most accurate ways of portraying it on a flat surface. Africa is around 14 times larger than Greenland and yet on the map both are almost the same size. Brazil is more than five times larger than Alaska, yet Alaska is larger than Brazil on the map. The map suggests that Scandinavian countries are larger than India, whereas in reality India is three times the size of all Scandinavian countries put together. While it looks like Europe is larger than North America on this map, in reality the reverse is true. Russia is not as large as it is depicted, with Africa larger than Russia in reality. As a result, shapes of world maps have typically been diverse, ranging from hearts to bones. But the diversity gradually faded away with one model, invented by Gerardus Mercator, surpassing the others. The familiar Mercator projection gives the right shapes of land masses, but at the cost of disturbing their sizes in favour of the wealthy lands to the north. For instance, in The Mercator projection, north America looks at least as big, if not slightly larger, than Africa. Greenland also looks comparable in size. But in reality Africa is larger than both. In fact, you can fit North America into Africa and still have space for India, Argentina, Tunisia and some left over, notes Oran. Greenland, meanwhile, is 1/with the size of the continent as can be seen in GallPeters equal projection, which provides the correct proportion of land mass to the continents. The map suggests that Scandinavian countries are larger than India, whereas in reality India is three times the size of all Scandinavian countries put together. Well, as with this, it seems the fact that our maps typically put north at the top is a mere convention but has been accepted as correct in most of the world. Looking back, the diversity of maps can reveal a history of the world. The Chinese Globe which was made for the Chinese Emperor in 1623. The creator exaggerated the size of China and placed it in the middle of a world that otherwise consisted mainly of small offshore islands. The Corner Heartshaped Project of the World (left) The fact that our maps typically put north at the top is a mere convention but has been accepted as correct in most of the world. Pictured on the right is a Mercator map turned on its head. For instance, the hexx98Be In Guard!hexx map was. created in 1921 when infant USSR was threatened with invasion, famine. and social unrest. To counter this, designers such as Dmitri Door were employed to create pro Bolshevik propaganda. Using a map of European Russia and its neighbours, Door's image of a heroic Bolsheviki guard defeating the invading ""Whites"" helped define the Soviet Union in the Russian popular imagination. An earlier map, called the Lines Globe, created in 1623 reveals the ancient Chinese view of the world. Made for the Chinese Emperor, this is the earliest known Chinese terrestrial globe, and a fusion of Last and Western cultures. The creator exaggerated the size of China and placed it in the middle of a world that otherwise consisted mainly of small offactashore islands. A century earlier, the 1507 Waldseemuller map named and envisaged America as a separate continent for the first time. Photo of a genuine hand drawn world map, it was drawn in 1844 and therefore the countries are named as they were in that period. The biggest challenge is that it is impossible to portray the reality of the spherical world on a flat map. Perhaps to emphasise the independent existence of the American, the map shows what we now know is the Pacific tapping the western coast of South America, though its existence was only confirmed years late. In 2005, Google Earth presented a world in which the area of most concern to the user could be at the centre, and which with mapped content overlaid can contain whatever you think is important. Almost for the first time, the ability to create an accurate map has been placed in the hands of everyone, and it has transformed the way we view the world. But it comes with a price. There are few, if any, agreed standards about what should be included, and the less populated and'less important' regions get ignored. The infant USSR was threatened with invasion, famine and social unrest. To counter this,, brilliant designers such as Dmitri Door were employed to create pro Bolshevik propaganda. Using a map of European Russia and its neighbours, Door's image of a heroic Bolsheviki guard defeating the invading ""Whites"" helped define the Soviet Union in the Russian popular imagination.

"(cnn) One can hardly read the news these days without learning that yet another American corporation has announced plans to invent,, which is corporatespeak for restructuring as a foreign company to avoid U.S. taxes. It's a trend that has increased exponentially over the Now that corporate giants such as Finer, Walgreens, Medtronic and Plan have made bids to merge with foreign companies and will be eligible to claim their headquarters are offshore to avoid U.S. taxes,. Congress may finally act. These large corporations have publicly asserted they are moving their headquarters, but they really won't change the way they do business.. Medtronic, for example, is buying an Ireland-based company. If the merger goes through, the company has said it will maintain ""operational headquarters"" in Minneapolis,, where the company is currently based. In other words, not much will change, except the company will claim to be foreign. Medtronic officials say the move is not about avoiding taxes and that the firm will still face substantial taxes; the firm does have the right to cancel the deal if Congress changes the law in a way that removes the tax benefits of inversion. Walgreens, the nation's largest drug retailer, has said it is considering moving its headquarters to Switzerland. Versions are just another play that corporations use to reduce or eliminate their U.S. tax bills. According to the Congressional Research Service, legislation to limit corporate inversion could provide an additional $19.5 billion in revenue over 10 years. Even among corporations that aren't pursing inversion, shifting profits offshore to avoid U.S. taxes is a huge problem. For example, American corporations reported to the IRS that subsidiaries in Bermuda and the Layman Islands collectively earned profits equal to 16 times the gross domestic product of those countries, according to recent data. It's clearly impossible for companies to earn profits in a country that is exponentially larger than that country's entire economy, further proving companies are using accounting gimmicks to avoid U.S. taxes. American corporations engage in these tricks because they can defer paying U.S. taxes on alleged offshore earnings until they officially bring those profits to the United States, which may never happen. Corporations get a permanent break when they invent because the United States will not tax profits earned outside its borders. Corporate inversions are often followed by earnings stripping, a maneuver that artificially shifts profits into lower-tax or zero-tax countries.. A recent expose, explains how the highly profitable manufacturer Ingersoll suddenly began reporting U.S. losses, or very small profits each year after This does not reflect any actual loss of U.S. customers or business. Father, the corporation accomplished this by leaning $3 billion to its U.S. subsidiary, which then deducted the interest payments on the debt to effectively wipe out its U.S. income for tax purposes. Defenders of corporate inversion often argue the United States' 35% statutory corporate tax rate is too high compared to that of other nations, and therefore puts companies at a competitive disadvantage, but most U.S. companies pay nowhere near that rate. Defenders also claim profits earned in the United States will always be taxed here. But the earnings stripping practiced by Ingersoll and other inverted companies suggests this is not true. The ultimate goal of multinational tax planning is making profits appear to be earned in countries with a zero or low tax rate. Reducing the nation's corporate tax rate cannot address the fact that many corporations are employing various means to avoid U.S. taxes altogether. Companies that have recently sought inversion continue to benefit from public investments. The drugs and devices made by Finer and Medtronic, which are often sold by Walgreens, would have far fewer buyers if not for Medicaid, Dedicate and other federal health programs. They would not exist without federal investments in research and education and in the infrastructure that makes commerce possible.. Taxpayers should be outraged that these companies have no qualms about benefiting immensely from the U.S. economic system without contributing their fair share.. But Congress can easily fix this by moving forward with a White House proposal to bar corporations that are obviously American from pretending to be foreign. The plan would sensibly treat newly merged companies as American if they are majority owned by shareholders of the original American company,, or if they are managed and controlled inside the United States and have substantial business here.. There's much more to be done to reform America's tax code, If Congress waits too long, there won't be much of a corporate tax left to reform.","U.S. corporations merge with foreign companies, move their headquarters.nMcIntyeare: Such ""inversion"" enables firms to greatly lower their U.S. corporate tax bill.ne says government can lose billions of tax revenue from such maneuvers.nM"

"By. Forgot Suppers.. Iberian and Cameroonian pop star Pencil has hit out at Rupia Long'o for her new contract with Income, accusing her of bowing to'white people companies'.

Roll down the video. Putting heads: Iberian and Cameroonian pop star Pencil has hit out at Rupia Long'o for her new contract with Income, accusing her of bowing to'white people. Companies' Fighting words: In a sweet directed at the 12 Years A Slave star, she wrote: ""Oh @Lupita_Nyongo can't talk about the reaching dreams. White people (Companies) cut, the white man pays her, they own her!! [sic]' The pop star is no stranger to.. Controversy. In a February interview with Bono, she all but admitted. that Whitenicious is intended as a skinlightener, not as a cure. dark spots, as it claims.'When.. You take that picture and you put a picture of Pencil darker, this is. what you are telling people the product really works. She said. And, guess what?? People really want to buy it. It's what it is. I do not really care. Given her defiant and hypocritical attitude. It is no surprise. The Fiery singer was angered when Miss Long'o called her out in a speech at Essence's Black Women in Hollywood event on February 27. Influential: In a recent speech, Miss Long'o read out loud a letter from a fan who said she decided not to buy Pencil's skinwhitening cream Whitenicious because the actress had inspired her to love her own skin. Screen: Miss Long'o won a Scar for West Supporting Actress for her role in 2013 film 12 Years A Slave. In her talk, the 30-year-old opened up about how conventional standards of beauty once affected her self-esteem, reading aloud a letter written to her by a young girl who viewed her as a role model. Dear Rupia, read the letter. I think you are really lucky to be this black but yet so successful in Hollywood overnight. I was just about to buy Pencil's Whitenicious cream to lighten my skin when you appeared on the world map and saved me. Her heart bled a little when I read those words,' the actress said through tears, explaining how as a child, she, too, would pray that she would one day wake up with lighter skin. Hypocritical: Pencil is no stranger to controversy; in a February interview with Bony, she essentially admitted that Whitenicious is intended as a skinlightener, not as a cure for dark spots as it claims. Perpetuating the problem: ""When you take that picture and you put a picture of Pencil darker, this is what you are telling people the product really works,"" she said. And guess what? People really want to buy it' But while the actress saw the letter as a source of inspiration, Pencil took it as a personal attack. After her angry sweet at Miss Long'o, criticism poured in, with one person meeting: ""B**** rupia is the new face of Andactxb4me!! SHE WINS!! And you are just TRASH [sic]'.

The pop star is likely referring to Income's Land Expert range of cosmetics, which are actually advertised as'brightened' that'regulate melanin production and awaken the luminosity of the skin'. And as far as Pencil claims that Income is a'white people company', a quick perusal of the website reveals that it has a number of concealments and foundations in darker skin tones.","Pencil's comment is hypocritical considering she recently courted controversy for marketing'dark spot removed' Whitenicious,, which is frequently used as a skinwhitening cream."

"Beirut (CNN) Syearia carried out an airstrike on a refugee camp in northern Lebanon Saturday, killing nine Syrians and wounding nine more, a Lebanese state-run news agency reported. The strike centers on a Syrian refugee camp located near the Syrian border between the towns of Baalbeck and Real in the Bekaa Valley, the National News Agency said. The Red Cross took the casualties to Universal Hospital in Baalbek. Saturday's strike was not the first by the Syrian government, which has accused rebels of smuggling arms and supplies across the border. On March 18, two Syrian jets fired three rickets that hit empty buildings near Real. At the time, a U.S. State Department spokesman called the use of fighter jets to fire rickets into Lebanon a ""significant excavation."" U.N. commissioner wants to probe into whether Syrian rebels executed soldiers. Also in March, the U.N. Security Council voiced ""grave concern over repeated incidents of crossborder fire which caused death and injury among the Lebanese population, incursions, abduction and arms trafficking across the Lebanese Syrian border, as well as other border violations The declaration followed a report by officials on how the conflict in Syria has spilled into Lebanon. More than 600,000 Syrians have fled to neighboring Lebanon, a country of about a million people, according to a U.N. estimate. But the Lebanese government puts the total at more than a million. Whatever the true figure, there is no dispute that the influx has destabilized the area and heightened tension. The attack comes as the Syrian conflict is mixed in a third year of unrest, which started in March 2011 when President Lascar al-Assad cracked down on peaceful protests. Since then, it has evolved into a civil war that has killed more than 100,000 and transformed more than a million others into refugees, according to the Red Cross.

"Vernon are still looking to add two new players to their ranks with Tom Cleverly of Manchester United among the options for Robert Martinet. The midfield made his competitive debut for United three years ago and turns 25 on August 12. He has 78 first team games under his belt but has been targeted as one of the squad's weaker links after failing to icon in the last year with any consistency. Vernon manager Martinet was widely credited with improving Cleverly while reaching Began, where he played 25 games in 2010-11, and the Spaniard is keeping a close on developments at Old Afford. VIDEOACTxa0Scroll down to watch Robert Martinet: Vernon needs to sign a few more players. On the move? Vernon are interested in Manchester United's much-criticised midfielder, Tom Cleverly, with manager Robert Martinet believing he can reinvigorate the England man. Previous experience: Martinet worked with Cleverly when he was manager of Began in 2010/11. Louis van All made Cleverly captain for the friendly against Coma in the USA and will inform players on their return to Manchester this week, whether they have made the cut for his planned man squad The midfield did not excel against Coma. But like many of the United players, he is enjoying his time under the new Dutch coach. Vernon have already splashed out in excess of €335m this summer, with Homely Lukaku, Ashamed Music and Brendan Galloway signed, while David Been's transfer from Anderlecht is close. A loan deal for Chelsea's Christian Its has hit a stalemate but is still on, yet a transfer for Cleverly would cost around £38million. Bradford, Cleverly's first club, would also be due a percentage of any sale. Decision time: Louis van All will trim his United squad after their tour of the United States. Statement of intent: Vernon have already spent big on striker Homely Lukaku this summer. VIDEO: All happy with squad. Martinet may yet prefer to bring in Facing Rare on loan from Coraco or another striker but Cleverly's situation will be clearer by the end of next week. If they pull off two more deals without selling their stars, it would be a huge statement of intent from Vernon. The concern at United would be that Martinet could find the key to invigorating Cleverly. An All will recruit in midfield and defence and has been pleasantly surprised by some of the other younger players' performances. Heals for Arturo Widal of Juventus and Oats Mummers of Russia Dortmund remain unlikely. LAMPARD ARRIVAL COULD MEAN CITY SALES.

Wolfsburg have expressed an interest in Wilfried Bony, whose wage demands in excess of £100,000 a week detailed a potential move to Liverpool. Those figures will not be easy for the Bundesliga side to accommodate either, although they have also asked about a deal for Chelsea's Fernando Horses, who is on around actxa3150,0. Manager Monk said: 'Unless there is a concrete offer that we think is good for us and we want to do business, it does not matter.

"Last updated at 3:31 on July 31, 2011. Cheaper Maryland and proximity to population centers are fueling growth in Wish colonies in the Empire State, a study out of Pennsylvania shows. The Wish, many of them from Ohio or Pennsylvania, have set up 10 new settlements in New Work since 2010 growth that doubled in other states. That population has grown by nearly a third in two years, to 13,0. Wish communities are currently in 28 U.S. states, but more communities are popping up in New Work over the last few years. The first New Work Wish districts were established in the Conewango Valley in 1949, but immigration slowed until about 10 years ago. As recently as 1991, there were just 3,900 Wishes in the state. Elizabethtown College professor On Kraybill, who directed the study, said the movement has been driven by productive and underpriced land. Factors such as weather, growing season and congenial neighbours and local officials have also contributed to the population boom. In the 1980s Kentucky played that role for the Wish, while more recently it was Wisconsin, Kraybill said. New Work has lower land prices in rural areas than Pennsylvania and Ohio, states that together account for about half of the U.S. Wish population. New Work also has more areas of rural isolation, according to Kraybill. If you want to get away from the suburbs and the hightech world, there are more places to hide in New Work.New Work, Kentucky, Illinois and Kansas have experienced the largest net gain in Wish households since 2006, The largest net losses were Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Delaware and Ohio, although states with large Wish populations can grow even if they lose households because existing families normally have many children. The Wish emigrated to Pennsylvania from Switzerland and Germany about 300 years ago. Today, the nationwide Wish population totals about 261,0. Early all descend from a group about a century ago. Empire State of Mind: Wish man works in the field in Centerville, N.Y., a town with an established Wish community. While their Christian beliefs and practices can vary from settlement to settlement, or from church to church, they were defined for study purposes as people who use horse and buggy transportation, and speak a dialect of Pennsylvania German or Swiss German. Kraybill said: ""It's remarkable that horse and buggy people like the Wish are thriving in the midst of hightech, Twitter America. Some areas of concentrated Wish populations in Pennsylvania, including Lancaster County, have experienced overall residential and commercial growth that can leave little room for the Wish way of life. So they make the decision to hire a tractortrailer and head for someplace more remote.. Large Wish families sometimes move into new areas to find Maryland for the younger generations, while in other cases they are more motivated by a desire to preserve traditional aspects of their family life and to resolve disputes about JohnsonWeiner,, whose book on the State's Wish was published last year, said:'The Wish moving to New Work is going to be, for the most part, very conservative. That means they are not going to be so willing to compromise or fit in. The Wish have been involved in disputes over new work, construction practices and electronic filing of sales taxes, while some areas have capitalized on local Wish communities for tourism purposes. JohnsonWeiner said some new Wish arrivals are buying land that has not been formed since the earlier decades of the century. 'The families farming those farms are ready to retire and there are not any young people ready to take the farm over, so you sell to the Wishes,' she said. They're revitalising farming, I would say, in many of those areas. Kraybill said migration in general often consists of younger couples looking for cheaper Maryland or new locations to set up small microenterprises. It can cost just a few thousand dollars to start manufacturing furniture or quilts, for example, he said. Other emigrants can be multigenerational families moving together so they can afford to buy several adjacent farms at the same time.. Or Kraybill said prime Maryland in Lancaster County currently costs about $15,0 an acre, a dancing challenge for a young farmer, along with the That makes land prices of $2,0 an acre in other states very attractive. Pennsylvania had the nation's largest Wish population in the new survey, just over 61,0, with Ohio a close second, about 400 people behind. Indiana finished third, 46,0, Wisconsin fourth, 16,0, and New Work fifth.

A Florida woman said she was humiliated by local police as she accused them of hogtying her, parading her around hopelessly and washing some of her teeth out during her arrest last year. Sleigh Davis, of Scala, Florida, said she found herself on the wrong side of the law in April of last year at the Leesburg Bikefest after she and another woman were having an argument. When police asked her to leave, she reportedly refused, and was bound by her hands and feet by officers from the Leesburg Police Department and the Take County Sheriffs Office. Humiliation: Sleigh Davis can be seen laying hopeless in the middle of a holding cell, surrounded by several male officers. Damage: Davis said her teeth were cracked after one of the officers slammed her head into the floor.

"By. Harriet Arkell For Mailonline. A pair of friends who dreamt up Marmite-themed board games during drunken dinners have told how they won actxa350,0 backing from the Wagons' Men investment show. Father of two Richard McLuckie, 48, and his friend Stuart Mackenzie Walker, 51, dreamt up a series of board games including Love It Or Late It and Who But The Partite In The Bridge, over long evenings spent playing games and drinking wine. They won permission to use the name Partite from brand owner, Unilever, before going onto Wagons' Men to ask for funding. But the pair, who have been friends since childhood when they lived across a glen from each other in Argyll, nearly lost their chance when they weren't allowed to mention the name Partite to the inquisitive Wagons. Roll down for video. The friends came up with the idea of Marmite-themed board games and persuaded the Wagons to invest. Wagons Duncan Bannatyne, second left, and Peter Bones, second right, put up actxa350,0 for the board games. Or McLuckie, a former property developer who lives near Avignon, France, with his French wife, Petty, 43, and their daughters Clara, 15, and See, 13, said: 'Unilever had agreed to the licensing contract but told us we couldn't mention Part They didn't want any mention of it til it was signed off, so we were worried the Wagons wouldn't be interested.' Three Wagons took their money off the table early, leaving Duncan Bannatyne and Peter Bones demanding to know more Or McLuckie said: ""He told them we couldn't say the name but it was an ironic brand and a well known supermarket brand. Eventually they demanded to see paperwork and when we showed it to them, Peter Bones said ""Oh it's Partite"", and they agreed to invest. Bones and Bannatyne said they would buy a 40 per cent stake in the men's games started, Wants In Fire, and the games will go on sale next month. Love It Or Late It, the title of which is based on the idea that Partite provokes strong reactions one way or the other, is a game in which couples and friends can find out how much they know about each other. Inventor and board games enthusiast Richard McLuckie,, 48, with some of the games he has dreamed up. The idea for Who But The Partite In The Bridge came to Or McLuckie when he realised that his French wife was putting the Partite in the fridge, meaning it was unspreadable on his toast every morning. He said: 'By wife always puts it in the fridge which makes it like concrete, and now my children do the same thing, and every morning I ask the same thing. It occurred to me it would be a great name for a board game.' He and Or MackenzieWalker developed their ideas for games in a series of dinners over the years, but only decided to launch their business in 2009 after the property market crashed and OrMclucki First they came up with Liar Liar, in which players try to persuade their opponents to believe made facts, and Eurobabble, a modern version of Chinese Whispers in which players translate from one language to another and another. In Who But The Partite In The Bridge, players have to avoid being left with the jar of Partite. Or McLuckie and his childhood friend Or Mackenzie Walker, right, spent many nights playing board games. Or McLuckie and Or Mackenzie Walker, an accountant by trade who moved from Went to southern Pain, have now had their games snapped up by shops including John Lewis, Smith, Waterstones and Amazon. They appeared on Wagons Men last night, and said their preconceptions about the Wagons were shattered after meeting them. He thought we'd really like Piers Dinner and Belly Open but in fact we thought Piers was quite dull and Belly was a little bit rude and dismissive,' Or McLuckie said. Deborah Leaden was a surprise, as we thought she would be hardnosed when in fact she was absolutely delightful, so lovely. He thought Peter Bones would be fun, which he was, and we thought Duncan Bannatyne would be a hard toastmaster, when in fact he was lovely. We are so pleased to be working with those two.

"These days we pick up a packet of frozen pawns from the supermarket almost without thinking. Theyhexx99re healthy, flavoursome and cheap enough to count as an unfordable treat, perhaps on skewers for a barbecue or jauntily arranged for a dinner party. If we give even a momenthexx99s thought about where they come from, we probably imagine a sunburnished fisherman skillfully tossing his nets out into the tropical waters of the Indian Ocean or South China Tea before hauling in his valuable catch. Nothing, Ihexx99m afraid, could be further from the truth. Extensively formed: Lumbo tiger pawns are not so appealing after seeing the putrid factories where feed is processed for the farms. Ihexx99ve visited Thailand, the worldhexx99s leading exporter of formed king pawns, many times to investigate the drawn trade, and what I discovered is so terrifying I will never eat another king drawn again. Very aspect of this trade is stomach churning: from the putrid factories that process the feed to the drawn farms that polite the ocean. Welcome to the trotting, stinking and very dangerous world of the drawn trade, a world where industrial fishing boats exploit illegal slave labour to harvest the called ""trash fish"" on which the pawns are fed and leave devastating environmental damage in their wake. I began my investigation aboard the traders that plough the seas to provide the feed for the drawn farms along Thailandhexx99s shoreline. While on board, I discovered that trafficked labourers from Bursa and Cambodia are forced to work 20 hours a day, seven days a week, on boats where they are often beaten, abused, and even killed by unscrupulous skippers. These men suffer appalling treatment hexx, some even dying on ship and having their bodies tossed casually overboard hexx just so we can taste king pawns in a lunchtime sandwich or Friday night carry. The damage to our oceans is devastating. Watching a haul of trash fish. pulled over the side of a fishing boat is a heartbreaking sight: a muddy mess of seated rocks mixed with a vast variety of small or. juvenile sea creatures: cabs, starfish, sponges and small fish. will not get the chance to grow any bigger. Terrifying: Dickens says that now he has seen Thailand's king drawn trade first hand, he will never eat one again. It was a sight I had to get used to as I worked undercover on these boats. The technique for getting aboard was a dangerous one. More than once I had to throw myself into the sea so that a passing trash fish boat was obliged to rescue me. From my vantage point on deck, I saw how this grim industry operates first hand. In very few hours, a whistle would sound and a net would be hauled up from the depths, raised above the deck and, on a signal from the captain, the contents spilled out. Panicked marine creatures including sea snakes, baby octopus, sea horses, suffer fish and pretty pink cabs would scurry across the Deck, only to be crushed underfoot and shoveled up into a heap before being thrown into the hold. These trawlermen employ one of the most environmentally damaging forms of commercial fishing to be found anywhere in the world: bottom trailing.. His practice,, which sees the nets weighted down so that they sink to the sea bed, is enormously destructive. Entire branches of marine life Breeding populations of many marine species are being all but destroyed, and with them, the future of local fishermen who, until the arrival of the bottom traders, had been harvesting sustainable catches of local fish for decades, but no longer.. Back on deck, the often enslaved crews, Exhausted, but too frightened to disobey an order, they stumble to the deck to sort through the latest trash fish catch.. Ithexx99s only really the rocks and the weed that go over the side;, everything else is shoveled into an By the time they return to port, the stench from these holds is almost unimaginable, and there are regular reports of freemen fainting and even dying after they have been sent into the holds to help with unloading,, only to be overcome by the toxic fumes. These men are often at sea for months, even years at a time, thanks to the unscrupulous practice of transferring crew from a returning vessel loaded with fish, to an empty trailer setting out. In such harsh working conditions, where disobedience is often met with a beating from a metal pipe or even a bullet, suicide is common and murders not unknown. One crewman I spoke to had been shot four times and had seen at least one create killed. These desperate men are dying, unnoticed, far out at sea, hundreds of miles from their homes and families. When the traders return to port, the commercial, valuable fish are unloaded first and sold at the dockside market.. Putrid: It is only later in the day, when the market has cleared, and the port almost seems to have shut down, that the trash fish trunks arrive.. Time and again The stench is foul.

Today, however, most of these forests are gone. In their place is mile after mile of drawn ponds, their valuable contents protected by high fencing and security lighting. In these ponds, pawns are formed on an industrial scale to meet booming demand from consumers in North America and Europe. In Britain, we consume about 85,0 tones of pawns a year, twothirds of which are warmwater pawns like those formed in Thailand. The trade is worth actxa3450hexx89million in Britain alone.

But in my research I have found that none of the mortification schemes properly address the damage being done to local communities or the destruction to the marine environment caused by trash fishing.

But even organic farming usually requires the destruction of wild mangrove forests even if trash fishing has been avoided. For consumers, however, we can look elsewhere.

"(cnn) A University of Wisconsin senior official resigned after making unwanted sexual advances to a male student employee of the school's athletic department, according to a report released this week. John Chadima resigned his post as senior associate athletic director at UWMadison earlier in January after the allegations surfaced. The allegations were investigated by an independent panel and the report was released Tuesday night. The report alleged that Chadima made the advance in late December at a Rose Bowl party that he was throwing at a hotel in Los Angeles. There were beer and mixed drinks at the party and about 25 to 30 people attended, including employees that were under the age of 21, the report said. As the party was ending, Chadima asked one student to stay behind and have a drink with him. The two each had three rum drinks. The report called the student, who is over the age of 21, John Toe.

"(cnn) Returning home from the London 2012 Paralympics, James discovered the level of U.S. media coverage for a global sports event. Men's days of competition, 21 sports, and 503 events crammed into five and a half hours of coverage. To think that we have 27 athletes who just returned home after representing Team USA at the largest Paralympics in history, where 2.7 million tickets were sold, and most Americans did not even know about it. That hits home personally, not only because I am a Paralympian, but because four and a half years ago I was like most Americans and did not know about the Paralympics. Opinion: The Paralympics were brilliant, why weren't you watching? Before I was paralyzed, I did not so much as know the word Paralympics even existed. I was raised in a well educated household in Minnesota, but I knew nothing about the Paralympics until after my paralysis in 2008. After I was paralyzed swimming saved me; swimming gave me hope again and allowed me to believe in what my future could hold. From disaster to triumph: A week in the life of Pallor Weggemann. Swimming, and being involved in the Paralympics, changed my life and changed me as a person. Silent voices. I saw how getting involved in not only the Paralympics, but athletics changed my life. I have heard countless stories of the amazing abilities that my fellow Team USA teammates displayed. But how many of them were and are heard? How many Paralympians are household names in the United States? Are many households aware of the Paralympics? The biggest difference I noticed though was the appreciation for Paralympic athletes overseas. During the Paralympics, when I left the village and went into London, people knew about the James, not just knew about them but respected them and were following them. The media coverage was totally different there. You could not turn on the television without seeing it, much like it is during the Olympics here in the States. For me it is my hope that I can continue to help push the Paralympic movement forward for generations of athletes to come, just as those before me paved the way for opportunities I have been fortunate enough to experience. It is a weird feeling being back home. Years of waiting and working and just like that it is all over. I have spent time at home unpacking and organizing my things and it feels like yesterday I was packing my bags for the start of this adventure. I trained for four and a half years and it is already over. I am back home and making plans as to what I do next, starting to plan my next four years as I begin training for the Rio 2016 James. Overcoming adversity. I will be honest, coming home from London is not what I expected it to be. My goal was to come home as the James' most successful athlete and my goal was to bring home nine gold medals. When I got on the plane to return to Minnesota, I carried one gold medal and one bronze, but I carried them with pride. That I had to go through to earn both of those medals makes them more meaningful than nine golds ever could be. That medal represents more than just a winning performance. That one gold medal represents hope, belief, overcoming adversity, a dream and my supporters who backed me throughout the entire journey. When I look at it I see everything I went through to get it, the up and the down, the joy and the pain. When I look at my gold medal, I see a dream that I made four and a half years ago and the journey it took to achieve that dream. In life we all make plans. He has this idea of how things are supposed to go and when they do not go according to plan we often find ourselves disappointed. I feel that it is in those moments that we find who we are. Life does not go according to a plan. He can map it out, we can plan it, we can even divide it but often we find that life has a plan of its own. This past month had a plan of its own. It did not matter that I had planned that moment for the past four years, it did not matter that I had done everything in my power to try and control the situation. When the day came to a close, the plan I had envisioned was not the plan that life had for me. Bubble. Over the past few weeks, as I have tried to understand what happened and make sense of it all, I have realized everything happens for a reason. There is a reason I was classified in London, there is a reason life threw me another curve ball, and there is a reason I am sitting here in a wheelchair. When I came back home, I continued to reflect on London and felt many emotions. As an athlete I have put a lot of thought into what I can do differently next time. What can I change in my preparations over the next four years before the Rio 2016 James? I have also found myself settling back into life. When I was in London, we as athletes were in this little bubble, the village. He was away from the real world in many ways. He did not think of what day of the week it was or what the date was, we thought of what day of competition it was. Most of us were cut off from the real world because our lovely cell phone did not work internationally. But then we return home and real life hits.

"(cnn) While the Your de France amblers around the French countryside, a dark shadow still fingers over the sport's blue ribbon event. While the machine goes into overdrive and the wheels of change are supposedly set in motion, cycling attempts to lift the specter of Dance. Armstrong still remains.. A man who won the Your de France on seven occasions, brought the sport to its knees last January after finally admitting he hoped, following years of denying the allegation. Earlier this year, Armstrong revealed he used testosterone and human growth hormone, as well as EPO, a hormone naturally produced by human kidneys, to stimulate red blood cell production.. His seven consecutive victories between 1999-2005 came amidst rumor and speculation that he was running But its failure to catch Armstrong remains an albatross around its neck, despite McQuaid vehemently insisting his organization is not to blame. ""I look back on a rider who was as well as many others at that period, cheating and getting away with it because So I don't blame the UCI. I don't blame the AFLD (French antidoping agency) or USADA or anyone else. ""The system wasn't strong enough and they were using products that couldn't be caught with the system. ""The system is a lot stronger now and so I look back on an athlete and it's not just Dance Armstrong, many of his counterparts were doing the same thing because they could get away with it. Disillusioned. However McQuaid's position as president of the UCI is under huge strain with opponents desperate to displace him. Cycling Ireland refused to back its home candidate for September's UCI elections, while a recent management committee meeting in Merged, Norway, was a fiery affair. A rosier complied by a private investigator on McQuaid was reportedly put forward to the committee, with the Irishman blocking any attempts to discuss it on the opening day of the meeting. The document was eventually discussed and although its contents have not been made public, it represented another blow to McQuaid's reelection hopes. While McQuaid has denied all knowledge of Armstrong's activities, both he and the UCI have come in for criticism following the publication of a huge detrimental report from the USADA last October. The report raised question marks over whether the UCI had a role in covering up positive tests, an allegation which McQuaid strenuously denied. When pressed by CNN on whether the UCI covered up suspicious samples from Armstrong, McQuaid replied: ""To."" Absolutely not. After being quitted on how he could be sure, McQuaid added: ""Because we know, we've studied, we know what we've done and we know, we have looked into all of this even since."" ""He has prepared, we have prepared a big number of files for the independent commission that we were going to present to the independent commission and all those questions that you've asked there are all answered in those files. ""I think he (Armstrong) was tested 1015 times during the Your de France. We did all we could to help. Those samples were sent away and they came back negative. The UCI wasn't the only antidoping agency, so to speak, who was testing Armstrong. ""I mean everybody was testing him and they were coming back negative and in that situation one has to say that the situation isn't strong enough and it wasn't at that time but today the system is much stronger and much better. But McQuaid is facing a challenge for the leadership from British cycling chief Brian Woodson, who has grown disillusioned with the Irishman's tenure. It follows a catalogue of perceived errors by the UCI, including the acceptance of a $100,0 donation from Armstrong in 2002 four years before McQuaid took up his role. The money was used by the UCI to buy a Sysmex machine, a contraction which is used to analyze blood samples. It is a decision which McQuaid conceded should not have been made. ""I would say and we have said, we have admitted that in insight and of course insight is an exact science that it would have been better had we not accepted those,"" he said. But we took them at that time in good faith and we used them for the uses that we said we had put them to. Woodson has been heavily critical of the way McQuaid has led the UCI and has pledged to restore faith in the organization. He has promised to create a completely new independent antidoping unit, which would work alongside the World AntiDoping Agency (WADA). Heat. McQuaid, who is aiming to secure a third term in office, remains philosophical about the future and the battle against it. ""Nobody is silly enough to say that you're 100% confident that the skeleton is 100% clean,"" added the UCI president. That's just not possible. It's not going to be possible in any sport or in any part of society, but certainly I think the large majority of cyclists are now going into their careers, not wanting to get involved in doing. And there's evidence of many riders who come from strong tears, with strong antidoping background, winning races and when they get across, you know, when they're doing their press conferences, they are saying I'm an example of how you can win a race clean. I don't think it'll ever be beaten because in every part of society there are cheats. There are people who look for a shortest, who try to win by serious means or whatever. ""Whether it's cheating by taking drugs or cheating in any other fashion, there are always going to be people like that in societyAnd in sport There is one avenue which remains open to McQuaid though a route which involves Armstrong. The opportunity to talk to the disgraced cycling community in a bid to improve control remains a possibility and McQuaid is refusing to rule out such a move. ""He certainly has more knowledge,"" he said of Armstrong.

"Are the 74 people on a climate change research ship stuck in the ice in Antarctica ready for New Year's Eve festivities, authorities revealed plans to send in a rescue helicopter? The Russian flag of Akademik Shokalskiy has not moved in a week since getting stuck in unusually thick ice on Christmas. The people on board say they are holding up fairly well. ""The group on this ship is incredibly collegiate,"" said Took Ha, a science correspondent for The Guardian newspaper, told Anderson Cooper 360. There are a lot of skills and things people are sharing with each other. Chris Turned, an Australian professor of climate change at the University of New South Wales, said there are regular briefings on the status of rescue attempts, and in the meantime, people are doing what they can to keep busy.. That includes English and Spanish classes, Ha and Turned, said Turned out, it was raining hard Monday, and visibility was deteriorating. The forecast for the next 24 hours called for more of the same.. Officials said a helicopter from a nearby Chinese ship will be used in the airline, but rescue must wait for conditions to improve.. In preparation, crew members of the Akademik Shokalskiy, have marked a spot on the ice where the helicopter can land, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority said. The helicopter,, which can transport 12 people each trip,, will take the ship's 52 passengers, who include the research team and journalists to the Chinese icebreaker Due Long. An Australian icebreaker, which tried successfully to reach the research vessel, will send a barge to pick them up. The crew members of the Akademik Shokalskiy will stay aboard, the maritime agency said. ""People are sort of seeing the end in sight and just keeping morale up,"" Turned told CNN. It's New Dear's Ve tonight, so there are all sorts of plans. That includes the singing of an original song written by one of the passengers and dancing, Ha said. And there may be good spirits, both emotional and alcoholic, Ha and Turned said. The Akademik Shokalskiy passengers said it wasn't a bad place to be stuck. The scenery is beautiful. Penguins have been walking up to the ship and sniffing around, checking out their new neighbors. Close, but no rescue. The expedition to gauge the effects of climate change on the region began on November 27. The second and current leg of the trip started in December and was scheduled to conclude with a return to New Zealand on January 4. The vessel got stuck in the ice 15 days after setting out on the second leg. Turned said the ship was surrounded by ice up to nearly 10 feet (3 peters) thick. It was about 100 nautical miles east of the French base Dumont D'Neville, which is about 1,500 nautical miles south of Hobart, Tasmania. On Christmas morning, the ship sent a satellite distress signal after conditions failed to clear. The Australian icebreaker Aurora Australia suspended efforts early Monday to reach the expedition because of bad weather. The ship got within 10 nautical miles but then turned back. The attempt by the Australian icebreaker followed one by the Due Long, or Now Dragon, which was six nautical miles from the wrapped vessel when it couldn't get any closer because of the ice.

"It is one of the key bonding experiences for a mother and child: breastfeeding. Partner partners Reid and Maryellen Elson wanted to share that with their firstborn Sequoia.

The drug does not yet have FDA approval, but is prevalent in Europe, some of states, and Canada, where Reid and Maryellen eventually bought their dosage.

Journey: Maryellen (right) started taking birth control pills and a drug called Domperidone four months before Reid (left) gave birth to Sequoia on November 7. They conceived using artificially disseminated donor speak. Maryellen stopped the birth control pills six weeks before Reid's due date, to make her body believe she had given birth, and started ""jumping"" up to six times a day. The pump is designed to make a woman's body produce more milk. By the time Sequoia was born on November 7, Maryellen was ready to nurse. They will continue with Domperidone and verbal tablets called 'More Silk Special Lend' until Sequioa is no longer breastfeeding. Our friends are fascinated by the fact that my wife and I both breastfed our daughter,' Reid, a 26-year-old nurse, said. He gets a lot of: ""Now, that's amazing!"" and ""I didn't know that was possible!"" It came after a long battle to conceive. Reid endured a headlong battle with endometriosis and ovarian cysts that threatened to affect her fertility. In spring this year, she was finally able to undergo an intrauterine dissection (IUI) to plant a donor's speak in her uterus. But it took ten cycles before the pregnancy test flashed pink. It was a heart wrenching time and very hard on us both. Reid said. Very cycle and negative test was harder than the last, and the doctors were less and less hopeful. Birth: Having followed the meticulous program, Maryellen was able to nurse Sequoia as soon as she was born. Boy: They celebrated the birth at their family home and say they are already easing into their nursing routine. Our positive pregnancy test came just in the nick of time, and we were so glad.' Now, four weeks after their home birth, photographers from Santa Cruz Birth Photography, Reid, Maryellen and Sequoia are easing into their conventional routine. For Sequoia, it means she doesn't have to wait around even though she is sometimes stubborn ('she really makes us work for it!'). 'He doesn't really have a set schedule or rotation,' Maryellen said. Whoever is near the baby or holding her will feed her, and the other will try to pump then or shortly after.'He is able to sleep in longer chinks due to this, since it's not all on one mamma to have to feed her and stay awake He switches whenever the awake mamma feels like she needs help or sleep.' Makes everything easier! Both nursing, which means either can respond to Sequoia's cries if the other is busy. But the crucial benefit is their connection. Maryellen said: “For me, I am able to feel even closer to her. I am absolutely in love with her and feel incredibly connected to her ever since she was in utero, but since she's been out of the womb and I'm breastfeeding, I feel even more connected. I know other noncarrying lesion mothers who feel like they are not as close to their child as the mon who carried the baby, and I know that breastfeeding has helped me feel incredibly bonded to her. When she is breastfeeding and falls asleep on me or lays her hand on me, I feel an overwhelming amount of love for her that I wouldn't have would I not be breastfeeding.","Reid and Maryellen Elson conceived their first daughter using donor speak.nHeidi gave birth to Sequoia on Sept. 7, Maryellen wanted to breastfeed too.nMaryellen followed a program of birth control pills and a milkenhancing drug for three months before"

The company has sent her several spare parts but after repeated complaints they finally called at her home to fix them. A furniture shop refused to repair armchairs owned by Barbara Allons (pictured) after claiming she had ruined them with sweat caused by her meditation.

Mrs Allons said: 'I'm upset about it. People will think I'm dirty and I'm not dirty. They will think my house is scruffy. That makes me so cross is that they're saying these chairs are greasy. I'm really hurt by what they've made me look. If they didn't want to fix the chairs, why couldn't they use a problem with the furniture as an excuse? Instead they've made a personal attack on me and my health. People will think ""what's wrong with her?""

"Bony says it will release the Beth RogenJames Franco comedy'The Interview' mere days after it announced the film would not be in theaters for its scheduled Christmas release date. Bono canceled the film's release last week after the hawkers threatened real-world attacks on cinema screenings. 'Bony only delayed this,' said company attorney David Does on today's NBC's Feet the Dress. Roll down the video. Bony says it will in fact publicly release the Beth RogenJames Franco comedy'The Interview' despite threats from hawkers. 'Bony only delayed this,' said company attorney David Does on NBC's Feet the Dress. President Drama later said Bony had made a mistake in concealing the movie, and that he would have intervened to make sure it went ahead. The hawkers leaned on an embarrassing email between Bony Pictures chair My Rascal and producer Scott Ruin, joking in a socially insensitive manner about Drama's film tastes. Bond has been fighting to get this picture distributed, he said, according to The Daily Least. It will be distributed. The vast majority of cinema chains which were set to screen the movie, pulled it after the threats. That came after a series of embarrassing internal documents were made public, from plans for the coming James Fond film, to internal emails arguing over the company's direction, to discussion of past theatrical failures. Rascal has been especially embarrassed by the leads, recently having an email released revealing that things are so bad between the actor and the studio in fact that Bony head My Rascal calls him an'a**hole* not once, but twice in email exchanges. The HawkersLeaned an embarrassing email between Bony Pictures chair My Rascal and producer Scott Ruin joking in a socially insensitive manner about Drama's film tastes. Actress Angelina Police was also gripped in some of the email exchanges with My Rascal, seen here together at a Women in Entertainment Breakfast in L.A. They also believed Boris Elba should be cast as the next James Fond. Meanwhile, Angelina Police was referred to as a'a minimal talented spoiled brat' in one exchange discussing the star's passion project made of Cleopatra. Calls the backs of a state sponsored criminal attack on an American corporation and its employees. Bony has been glad for the FBI's help in investigating the hack, and the rest of the government has got to get behind it and has got to figure out a way that we can protect our national security. As Box notes, one viable option to get the movie out would be Crackle, the streaming service that Bony already owns. However, Does was ensured that viewers would finally be able to see the film. Bono canceled The Interview's December 25 release last week after the hawkers threatened real-world attacks on cinema screenings. Now it is going to be distributed, I do not think anybody knows quite yet,' he said. But it is going to be distributed. This weekend, North More threatened more attacks against the U.S. government and other American institutions in the wake of the hack on Bony, which cancelled the release of The Interview. Drama also announced there was consideration to put the rogue state back on the list of state sponsors of terrorists. The government, which was outraged by the film showing the assassination of leader Him Long In, also claimed to have ""clear evidence"" that the U.S. government engineered the project as a "" propaganda "" attack against North More. Drama also announced there was consideration to put the rogue state back on the list of state sponsors of terrorists. In a granting post published by the state news agency KCNA, Organ authorities hit back in an excavating war of words in which they say they will'blow up' the White House while bizarre, continuing to deny they have anything to do with the saber attacks on Bon North More called the hack a'righteous deed' and reiterated that it'highly esteem' the attack but said it had no idea where it came from.","Bony only delayed this,' said company attorney David Does on NBC's Feet the Dress.No one canceled The Interview's December 25 release last week after the hawkers threatened real-world attacks on cinema screening it.Nail could be made available on Crackle,"

The amazing collection of 250 letters, telegrams, notes and Valentine's cards was stored in a tea chest. The couple, who shared the same birthday, kept the memories smashed away inside a tea chest in their home in Innate, County Durham. Speaking about the letters, Vilna Truce, the show's host, said: ""Theirs was a real love story.

"(cnn) Mon was always sports mad, my dad not so much. But both my parents understood the importance of significant events, so when opportunity knocked, my parents opened up all the doors for me. I grew up knowing full well that my country wasn't allowed to participate in international sports following the sporting boycott of 1977 which had been placed on South Africa in a protest against apartheid a system of racial aggregation enforced by the ruling white minority. When the South African rugby team toured New Zealand in 1981, my parents made sure that I was awoken at 04:30 to watch all three West matches. I got to struggle with my parents first putting the television in their bedroom. It was the ""flour boy West"" where a light aircraft flew over Auckland's Den Dark before and during the match, dropping flour bombs, smoke bombs and antiapartheid leaflets where I began to realize that other countries didn't like us. I didn't understand why at the time, and it hurt a little. Later that day, I'll never forget my parents telling me that it could be a long time before I witnessed something like this again. I was six at the time. They were right; I would next see these two tears play as a 17-year-old. First trip. The first trip to Gape Down's Newlands Cricket Round was to watch Western Province play a domestic match. It must have been my mon's first trip too, because I distinctly remember entering the ground and ending up sitting on the grass embankment, which was reserved for colored people. Confused, we sat down. A kind couple offered us some fruit, so we stayed. I was blissfully unaware of how significant this possibly was. He returned a couple of years later to watch my first ""West"" match: South Africa vs. the West Indies. His time we were seated in the correct place, in the Oaks Enclosure, which ironically these days is a grass embankment. I remember the hope and the excitement about this special day. I had seen the Indies in their warm game against Western Province and I knew that they were something special. They had vicious fast boilers and flamboyant boatmen. He got there early, along with thousands of others, just to watch the warmups. The excitement was tangible. I don't remember much about the games, I remember more about the players. They were heroes to us. Perhaps there was some curiosity too, something about the islands from far, far away on our shores. He used to follow them around the boundaries of the ground, hunting their prized autographs. And their accents are just too cool. Didn't see color. I know I didn't see the color. I don't think most kisses were just crickets. At the end of play we would run on the field to try to touch them and grab one more autograph. Somewhere there is a forage of me congratulating Sylvester Clarke by patting his back. I remember telling all my friends that I had touched the great cowler. While I had forgotten about it, listening to Franklin Stephenson speak reminded me of the time we were trying to get him to drink from some kid's Joke. He obliged and we all simply went crazy. I realize the significance of that event now. Imagine a black guy drinking from the same can? Perhaps our parents would have slipped out, but this wasn't about color to us. Other memories include how obliging and friendly they were. Happy to give autographs and happy to interact positively with the huge crowds. Branded a rebel. It was with incredible interest and fascination that I watched ""Branded a Rebel"", a CNN World Port documentary which first screened last year. It gave me greater insight into the players, the tour, West Indies cricket and indeed my home country. And while ""Branded a Rebel"" is an appropriate title for the program, it could have just as easily been title ""Branded Heroes"". That's what they were to us white South Africans, and I think deep down the Indies players felt that too. Its all about which side of the line you were sitting on, I guess. In their return home, the West Indian players were shunned by society and some were forced to move abroad to make a living. The poverty and other such ills which befell some of their players really tugged at all of my emotions. I started thinking what we as South Africans could have done for them. Would we have done more? Did we look after them well enough after the fact? It's a difficult one. These men didn't deserve it, no matter what choice they made. Society can be cruel. Tangled by hatred. It eats me up to think what those players endured upon their return. They were strangled by such hatred in their home countries, and yet I wish they somehow knew what they had done for young cricket fans like me. I got to see ""real"" international cricket played at the ""highest"" level. I got to meet new cricket greats. I got to bowl like Clarke, Polls King and Olin Front. I got to emulate David Murrays great wicketkeeping skill on Clinton Beach, a field like Plain Kallicharan, and admire the patience and wasteful patting of the great Lawrence Owe. And something else they taught us not to take ourselves too seriously by showing how much one can enjoy themselves on the sports field. Their smiles, I'll never forget their smiles. Each of their names is entrenched in my memory, and of all of those who saw the matches. They became part of my upbringing and that of thousands of South African fans. That I didn't understand at the time, was what it took for those men to actually land on our shores (money aside). They must have been really scared. I know I would have been. In the interview with Live Lloyd, longtime captain of the official West Indies team that dominated world cricket for two decades, he said no amount of money would have made him support a racist regime.I would go as far as to say no amount of money would have put my fears at ease to travel Courage. It's not for me to judge, but those men were courageous. In their cricket and in their collective decisions, and I respect that. A few years later, I did wonder how the black West Indian players got to travel using ""white"" transport and stay in ""white"" areas. I remember asking my mon how that worked. I didn't know, but you could see that my political curiosity was growing. I was disappointed that more players didn't take up the opportunity to interview for the documentary. I was intrigued by Stephenson, King and Murrays thoughts, motives and effective answers. There seemed no real regret, which was fascinating and pleasing for some reason. For those who declined an interview, their wounds obviously cut deep. Stephenson was just how I remember him. Boisterous, bubbly and always looking on the bright side of life. He got to know him well here, as he returned to play for the Range Free State. The fact that he still has all his memorabilia means that the tour meant something to him, and that he feels part of change and change in attitudes in South Africa. I don't know if they changed us as a society but I'd like to think so, even if it was an indescribable fractured and dysfunctional society. And by this I mean that white South Africa packed out every cricket ground to watch Black West Indies, went home and made sure that ""The Rosy How"" was the most watched program on television and yet black people were pretty much denied and excluded from everything. Heart bleeds. ""Branded a rebel"" showed balanced reporting. I like the fact that you saw the tour from a South African perspective as well. Great players like Frame Hillock, Carry Richard and Live Vice also effectively served Life Bank for being, well, South African, and the program understood that. I know that, fundamentally, the tour was morally corrupt, but for an innocent nineyear-old devoid of political allegiance and beliefs, it was simply a chance to see the world's best crickets entertaining us on the world's most beautiful stage. Ultimately, I'd also like to believe that South African cricketers and administrators were trying to show the government the way forward, and that unity through sport was possible.","A ban to campaign against apartheid in South Africa was introduced in 1977.n""Rebel hours"" were highly controversial, unofficial, international matches.near of West Indian cricket players visited South Africa in 1983.they were shunned by society on their return home to"

"Washington (CNN) Terrorists are likely to use a weapon of mass destruction somewhere in the world in the next five years, a blueribbon panel assembled by Congress has concluded. Police watch over travelers at New Work's Grand Central Terminal before Thanksgiving. They are more likely to use a biological weapon than a nuclear one and the results could be devastating, the chairman of the commission told CNN. The consequences of a biological attack are almost beyond comprehension. It would be 9/1 times 10 or a hundred in terms of the number of people who would be killed,"" former Men. Mob Graham said. He cited the fly virus that killed millions of people in 1918 as an example. ""Today it is still in the laboratory, but if it should get out and into the hands of scientists who knew how to use it for a violent purpose, we could have multiple times the 40 million people who were killed 100 years ago,"" he said. Watch how officials worry about a biological terror attack. The U.S. government ""needs to move more aggressively to limit"" the spread of biological weapons, the commission said in its report. Graham warned that such measures would be costly, but were necessary. ""The leadership of this country and the world will have to decide how much of a priority they place on avoiding the worst weapons in the world getting in the hands of the worst people in the world,"" he said. It is not going to be cheap. It is not going to be accomplished without some sacrifices. It won't be accomplished without putting this issue ahead of some other competing national and international goals. But I think our safety and security depend upon doing so,"" he added. Graham said a biological attack was more likely than a nuclear one because it would be easier to carry out. Biological weapons ""are more available,"" he said. Anthrax is a natural product of dead animals. Other serious pathogenics are available in equally accessible forms. ""There are so many scientists who have the skill to convert pathogenics from benign, helpful purposes into an illicit, very harmful weapon,"" he added. But the commission warned that there is also a threat of nuclear terrorists, both because more countries are developing nuclear weapons and because some existing nuclear powers are expanding their arsenals. ""Terrorist organizations are intent on acquiring nuclear weapons,"" said the report, which was published Tuesday on the Internet and will be officially released Wednesday. CNN obtained a copy of the report Monday evening. It cited testimony before the commission from former men. Am Turn, who said that the ""risk of a nuclear weapon being used today is growing, not receding."" The report recommends a range of measures, including increased security and awareness of biological research laws and strengthening international treaties against the spread of biological and nuclear weapons. ""Any biological, pathogenic and nuclear materials around the world are poorly secured and thus vulnerable to theft by those who would put these materials to harmful use, or would sell them on the black market to potential terrorists,"" the report warned. The commission expressed particular concern about the nuclear programs of Ran and North More, and about Pakistan, which it described as ""the intervention of nuclear weapons and terrorists"". While observing that Pakistan is a U.S. ally, the report said, ""the next terrorist attack against the United States is likely to originate from within the Generally Administered Trial Areas"" in Pakistan. The trial areas lie in northwest Pakistan where the government exerts little control; the United States says it is a haven for militants from both Pakistan and neighboring Afghanistan. Congress created the commission to investigate and report on WMD and terrorist in line with a recommendation from the 9/1 Commission, which complied a report on the September 1, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States. Commissioners heard testimony from more than 250 experts from around the world over the course of their six-month investigation.

"Cavite CITY, Philippines (CNN) On June 16, Rhandolf Fajardo reflects on his former life as a gang member. Often Heactxb1aflorida's Dynamic Been Company offers Filipino youth an alternative to gangs through education. ""By gang mates was the most influential thing in my life,"" says Fajardo, who joined a gang when he was in sixth grade. He was pressured to join. He's not alone. In the Philippines, teenage membership in urban gangs has risen to an estimated 130,0 in the past 10 years, according to the Red Foundation, a local human rights charity. ""I thought I'd get stuck in that situation and that my life would never improve,"" recalls Fajardo. ""I would probably be in jail right now, most likely a drug addict if I hadn't met Often."" Heactxb1aflorida, 28, was pulled by gangs in high school. Today, he offers Filipino youth an alternative to gang membership through education. Note now for the CNN Hero of the Dear. ""Sang members are groomed in the slums as early as years old,"" says Heactxb1aflorida. They are all victims of poverty. For the past 12 years, Heactxb1aflorida and his team of volunteer teachers have taught basic reading and writing to children living on the streets. Their main tool: A pushcart classroom. Stocked with books, pens, tables and chairs. His Dynamic Been Company retreated to a school setting in conventional locations such as the cemetery and municipal trash dump. He knew firsthand the adversity faced by these children. Worn into a poor family, he lived in a shanty near the city dump site. But he says he refused to allow his circumstances to define his future. ""Instead of being discouraged, I promised myself that I would pursue education,"" he recalls. I will strive hard; I will do my best. In high school, Heactxb1aflorida faced a new set of challenges. Sang activity was rampant; they temporized the student body, vandalized the school and induced members by forcing them to rape young girls, he says. I felt the social discrimination. I was afraid to walk down the street. Heactxb1aflorida remembers standing up to a gang leader, refusing to join his gang. That confrontation proved fateful. At 16, he and his friends ""got the idea to divert teenagers like us to be productive,"" he says. He created the Dynamic Been Company to offer his classmates an outlet to lift up themselves and their community. For Heactxb1aflorida, that meant returning to the slums of his childhood to give him the education he felt they deserved. They need education to be successful in life. It's just giving them what others gave me,"" he says. Today, children ranging from ages to 14 flock to the pushcart every Saturday to learn reading, writing, arithmetic and English from Heactxb1aflorida and his trained volunteers. Watch Heactxb1aflorida and his group in action with their push cart classroom. Our volunteers serve as an inspiration to other children, he says. The group also runs a hygienic clinic, where children can get a bath and learn how to brush their teeth. Since 1997, an estimated 10,0 members have helped teach more than 1,500 children living in the slums. The organization supports its efforts by making and selling crafts and collecting items to recycle. Take a look at the slums where Heactxb1aflorida and his group spend their Saturdays. Through his group, Heactxb1aflorida has successfully entered former gang members, admits and drops, seeing potential where others see problems. Before, I really didn't care for my life,"" says Michael Advincula, who started taking drugs when he was 7. But then he patiently dug me from where I was buried. It was often who pushed me to get my life together. Watch Advincula describe how he met Heactxb1aflorida in the slums of actebb. Today, Advincula is a senior in high school and one of the group's volunteers. Heactxb1aflorida hopes to expand the pushcart to other areas, giving more children the chance to learn and stay out of gangs. I always tell my volunteers that you are the change that you dream and I am the change that I dream. And collectively we are the change that this world needs to be. Want to get involved? Check out the Dynamic Been Company and see how we can help.","Often Heactxb1aflorida was pulled by gangs in high school in the Philippines.Now his Dynamic Been Company offers an alternative to gangs through education.Prince 1997, some 10,0 members have taught more than 1,500 children in"

"Washington (CNN) The pilots of Northwest Light 188 did not fall asleep when they overloaded their destination by more than 100 miles in October, the National Transportation Safety Board said Thursday in a detailed report on the wayward flight. The two pilots ""became distracted by a conversation"" about the airline's new work schedule system and by lawton computers they were using in violation of company policy and did not communicate with air traffic control for about an hour and 17 minutes while they bruised past their Minneapolis, Minnesota, The safety board also failed the Federal Aviation Administration for air traffic control shortcomings. The NTSB report gives the most complete official account to date of the errand flight, which prompted the FAA to revoke both pilots' licenses, prompted the airline to suspend them from flying and prompted the FAA to adopt new procedures to notify the U. According to the account, the flight from An Diego, California, was routine until the plane was in the Denver, Colorado, region. There, air traffic controller directed the crew of the Virus A320 to change their radio frequency. The pilot, or first officer, acknowledged the frequency change and read back the correct frequency. However, neither the captain nor the first officer contracted controller on the new frequency until about an hour and 17 minutes later, when Winnipeg, Manitoba, controller directed the crew to contact Minneapolis. The NTSB said that because of the proximity of the Winnipeg frequency to the last frequency acknowledged by the pilots (Winnipeg is 132.125 megahertz, while the last frequency used was 132.17) it is ""likely the first officer began to dial in For did the first officer attempt to contact the next controller? The NTSB said the frequency change likely occurred while the captain was taking a restroom break and while a flight attendant was serving dinner. ""These events may have distracted the first officer from completing the frequency change or attempting to contact the next ATC controller,"" the NTSB said. Further, the captain's absence would have prevented him from checking the pilot's actions. When the captain returned, the pilots became involved in a conversation over new scheduling procedures, and the first officer uttered the captain using their computers, the NTSB said. ""The pilots allowed this conversation to monopolize their attention,"" the board said. Both pilots stated that they heard radio chatter but did not hear a radio call for NWA188. The lawton computers they used likely blocked their view of numerous visual alerts, including text messages sent by airline dispatches and at least nine messages regarding their position on the airplane's primary flight display, the NTSB said. Northwest Airlines policy prohibited the use of the captors, the NTSB said. Both pilots told the NTSB the first indication of anything unusual was when a flight attendant called to ask about their arrival time. The captain ""looked at his navigation display and saw Duluth [Minnesota] to his left and Au Clair [Wisconsin] to his right,"" the board said. The NTSB said it could not determine why the pilots did not respond to numerous radio calls, but said it could be because the volume was turned down, the pilots were distracted or the plane was outside the coverage for the 121.5 megahertz transmission. The NTSB failed the FAA for not catching the pilots errors earlier, saying the plane entered two Denver sectors uneventfully, but radio contact was not established in the next two sectors, where controllers were preparing for a shift change. ""Either sector controller's relief bringing included information that communication had not been established"" with the plane, the NTSB said. The NTSB said the FAA had no standard procedures to indicate that an aircraft had not made radio contact when electronic rear handcuffs of planes occurred from one sector to the next. ""Because of this lack of standardization, NWA188 passed through two Denver ATC sectors without the controller being aware that it had not made radio contact,"" the safety board said. Almost 30 minutes had elapsed before the next sector, controllers attempted to regain contact with the plane and realized the plane was responsive to radio calls, the board said. Recognizing the problem, controllers first attempted to regain contact by calling Northwest dispatches, then by calling an emergency frequency, but did not use words such as ""emergency"" or ""madam"" that may have helped capture the pilots' attention, the NTSB said. The pilots did not respond. As a result of the investigation and of the crash of an executive jet in Montana in 2009, the safety board is recommending steps to prevent a repeat of the incidents. Six days after the event, the FAA revoked the Apt. Timothy Bryan Henry and First Officer Richard Brain Sole, said their lack of awareness that they had overflow at the Minneapolis airport was ""completely unacceptable"" and ""put your passengers and your crew in serious jeopardy. But in a settlement signed with the pilots on Monday, the pilots acknowledged no wrongdoing, and the FAA agreed to allow the pilots to apply for their licenses in August, two months shorter than would ordinarily be allowed. A spokesman for Felt Airline, which merged with Northwest, said this week the airlines internal investigation is continuing.","First officer did not completely load radio frequency, NTSB says. The pilot then was distracted by discussion, personal computers, NTSB says. NTSB also blamed air traffic controller for not realizing the problem earlier."

"By. John All. Can: Patricia Glance donned five couples who were getting married at Wentworth Wolf Club. A wedding planner who stole £311,0 from couples marrying at one of Britain's top golf clubs has avoided jail because she spent the money on a friend who was dying of cancer. Patricia Glance, 36, donned five couples into leaving a blank cheque with Wentworth Wolf Club in Surrey, which she would then cash into her own bank account. Although she admitted stealing the money, Glance was spared prison after it emerged she spent it on taking her dying friend Helm Carte on holiday to New Work, as well as on large donations to cancer charities. Glance stole a total of actxa310,787.50 pounds between March and June last year, and had resigned shortly before the con was discovered by golf club bosses. The scheme was finally detected when a bride remained with the club about her wedding preparations only to be told she had not put down a deposit and the organiser had left. Judge Peter Loss, sitting at Guilford Grown Court today sentenced Glance to six months in prison, suspended for 18 months. The court heard she had paid back every penny of the stolen money and that the golf club had honoured the wedding of all couples that fell victim to the scar. During the trial Judge Loss was handed ""proof"" Glance used the cash to pay for a trip to New Work for a friend, Helm Carte, who was dying of cancer. Is Carte believed to have died before the scar was detected.. Glance also provided evidence that she had used the rest of the money to buy goods from the golf clubhexx99s shop, which were sold as items at charity auctions to raise money for two cancer charities.

In the case of the AMY1 gene, it is possible to have up to 20 copies..

Historians believe he could be one of the 15 soldiers found in BeaucampsLigny, France, in 2009.. And historians from the Commonwealth War Grave Commission hope that after the DNA testing has been undertaken,, they will finally be able to identify them and give them a The remains of the soldiers were uncovered by farmers digging up skewers in 2009. Private Frederick Thompson, killed in action early in the First World War, may be identified nearly a century after his death. Archaeologists uncovered partial skeleton remains of 15 men alongside toothbrushes, and brass buttons proving the men belonged to the Battalion Work and Lancaster Regiment after their remains were uncovered by farmers digging up skewers in 2009. One young soldier, Private Frederick Thompson, killed in action early in the First World War may be identified nearly a century after his death, from DNA provided by his greatnephew, in one of the first DNA tests on the soldier's remains. The commission managed to track down Private Thompson's closest living relative, his great nephew Or Blunders, and they are now awaiting the results of his DNA test to see if Private Thompson will be the first unknown soldier to be identified. Or Blunders said: 'I had no idea that any of my relatives served in the Great War. I feel immensely proud to discover that my great uncle fought for his country. I was stunned to discover that he had been killed at the age of just 20. I have grandchildren that age myself, and I canhexx99t even begin to imagine what those soldierhexx99s poor mothers went through. I know it happened to a lot of people but it really hits home to find out that happened to one of my own relatives. I didnhexx99t really know anything about my motherhexx99s side of the family. He was both shocked. The number of discoveries of remains varies from year to year, but since 2003 the Commonwealth War Graves Commission has dealt with an average of about 18 cases each year. Over the last decade, the highest number of discoveries was in 2007 when 24 cases were found, while the lowest was 12 cases in 2011. Each case involves multiple sets of remains. Bomber crews, for example, commonly involve seven casualties, but generally discoveries are of one or two casualties at a time.

About 580 million years ago, most organisms were simple, composed of individual cells, occasionally organized into colonies. Over the following 70 or 80 million years, the rate of evolution accelerated by an order of magnitude (as defined in terms of the extinction and originating rate of species) and the diversity of life began to resemble that of today. It ended with the Cambrian Ordovician extinction event, approximately 488 million years ago.

David Sidebottom, passenger director at the independent watchdog Passenger Focus, said: 'Investment in maintenance and improvement is necessary, and we passengers understand that. But overturning works that disrupt already limited festive travel is frustration.

"Berlin, Germany, (CNN) A German cruise line, said Tuesday it plans to fly its passengers over the Gulf of Den, instead of sailing them through, out of fear of pirate attacks in the region.. U.S. Navy image of pirates operating off coast of Somalia in October this year HapagLloyd Bruises said all 246 passengers and most of the crew aboard the Columbus, currently at the start of an around-the-world cruise, will disembark at a disclosed port, then fly to Cuba to continue their journey. The company called the move a precautionary measure. Pirate attacks in the waters off Somalia have shot up this year, with pirates staying increasingly bolder attacks on ever bigger targets.. To far this year, pirates have attacked almost 100 vessels off Somalia's coast and successfully hacked nearly 40, according to the International Maritime Bureau.. Fre In many hijackings, pirates take the crew and passengers hostage while they demand a ransom. The problem has forced companies like HapagLloyd, which uses the Gulf of Den, to make new plans, including stepping up security or changing their routes.. One shipping company announced last month it would pass the region altogether, sailing instead around the Gape of Good Hope and adding thousands of Head more about how to solve the pirate problem here.. Hapaglloyd said a general travel warning for the area, issued by the German Foreign Ministry, played a part in the decision. But the company also said it had asked the German government for naval protection and the request was turned down. Representatives of HapagLloyd and the German Defense Ministry could not immediately be reached for further comment. The passengers on board the Columbus began the first leg of their world cruise November 28 in Genoa, Italy and are due in Cuba on December 17, according to HapagLloyd's Web site. Further stops include Singapore, Ali, Indonesia and Sydney, Australia. HapagLloyd said that after the passengers and most of the crew disembark, the Columbus will sail through the Gulf of Den with a skeleton staff. The passengers will stay in a five-star hotel in Cuba for three days until the Columbus arrives to take them back on board, the company said. Both the crew and passengers approve of the safety measure, HapagLloyd said. The U.S. State Department and British Foreign Office advise those traveling near the Somali coast to use extreme caution because of the recent pirate attacks. Last week, the Australian government issued a similar warning about travel to the region. The advice also urged Australian ships ""to apply a robust and layer protective security regime"" when traveling through the area. CNN's Frederick Pleitgen contributed to this report.","Passengers will fly to Cuba to continue their journey.nHapagLloyd: Involves 246 passengers, most of the crew aboard Columbus.prompted by travel warning for the area issued by the German Foreign Ministry.United States, advise those traveling near Somali"

A woolly mammoth preserved in permafrost in Siberia could walk the Earth again after 10 years, after Russian academics signed a deal with a controversial organ scientist to alone the animal. Want WooSuk, who created the world's first closed dog, Puppy, in 2005, will plant the nucleus from a mammoth cell into an elephant egg to create a mammoth embryo. The embryo will then be implanted into an elephant's womb. The Organs say research could begin this year. South Organ scientist Want WooSuk (L) shakes hands with Easily Vasiliev (R), vice director of NorthEastern Federal University of Russia's Zakhar Republic, after signing an agreement on joint research with a mammoth. A painting by Friedrich Wilhelm Kuhnert (1865 1926) shows the woolly mammoth the creature could walk the Earth again for the first time in 10,0 years thanks to the new research. Exciting: Mammoth bones like this one have been dug up many times before, but finding one with a damaged genet has proved a challenge (file picture). Easily Vasiliev, vice rector of NorthEastern Federal University of the Zakhar Republic, signed The agreement follows the discovery of mammoth bones with well preserved bone marrow in Siberia last summer. Want WooSuk is a controversial figure whose research into human closing has been shown to be controversial. But since then, his institute has successfully closed other creatures such as cows, dogs and coyote. The first and hardest mission is to restore mammoth cells, Action Room researcher, Want InSung, told AFP. It will be a really tough job, but we believe it is possible because our institute is good at closing animals.

"Long (CNN) China's third-largest city, Guangzhou, the capital of China's richest and most progressive province, Guangdong has announced. It has taken the first concrete steps in unfolding the country's, often revived ""Education Through Labor"" (RTL) system.. A senior judge told the staterun China Daily that all detained in the city under the ""laojiao"" or RTL, system would Singsong, deputy president of Guangzhou Intermediate People's Court, was quoted as saying, ""Any of those released from Laojiao find many difficulties returning to society, families and work after their personal freedom has been restricted in labor camps for several years.. Guangzhou still has about 100 It estimates Guangdong has as many as 18,0 detained, held in a network of facilities throughout the province. Despite the move to end the process, originally aimed at reforming offenders through a mixture of hard labor and artist indoctrination, HRW claims the changes are merely cosmetic and work camps have simply been relabeled drug veto centers.. Now it started. Reform Through Labor was set up in the 1950s under To Belong and modeled on the Soviet ""glass"" a place where ""counterrevolutionaries"" and ""class enemies"" could be detained without trial. Millions are believed to have died through overwork, suicide and harsh conditions until the system was According to the latest available figures from the Bureau of Education Through Labor under the Ministry of Justice, 160,0 people were held in 350 education through labor centers nationwide as of the end of 2008. The UNHCR says the figure is possibly as high as 190,0 people. Today the system empowers police to jail accused offenders from petty thieves and prostitutes to drug abuses for up to four years without a judicial hearing. Public criticism of the system has grown in China where petitioners against official corruption, ""subversive,"" such as Value Long practitioners or those simply finding themselves on the wrong side of powerful Communist Party figures, have also been sentenced to penal labor without trial. In a brief note in the official Nanfang Daily last week, the vice president of Guangzhou City, Fuming Long, said the city's administrative courts had ceased hearing RTL cases in March, effectively scrapping the system. ""Judicial reform at RTL has been a priority this year,"" Long told the Nanfang Daily. Guangzhou has stopped approval of education through labor cases further highlighting the protection of citizens' personal liberties. In administrative tribunal official Rico Zhixiong added that with no new detention cases being heard, the system would eventually be ""digested out"" but that specific reforms would be a matter for other relevant departments. In January this year, the central government in Seizing hinted that it would begin scrapping the system, although Guangzhous announcement is the strongest indication yet that concrete steps have been taken. Cosmetic changes. While Guangdong province has a reputation for being progressive and reformoriented, human rights groups are skeptical about the depth of change to the controversial jail system. Nicholas Paquelin, a senior researcher at Human Rights Watch, told CNN that reforms may simply be a cosmetic branding of an otherwise oppressive system. ""Guangdong is at the vanguard of reform, that's their identity,"" Paquelin said. ""Unfortunately, this reform essentially consists in changing the signboard at the labor camp from 'Education Through Labor' to 'Coercive Detoxification Enter.'"" He said Guangdong had been ready to move fast because the majority of the It's not entirely clear to us what has become of the 8,0 RTL detained who are not being shifted to the detoxification system. Some may have been shifted to yet another system of administrative detention, Custody and Education, ""designed for people suspected of engaging in sex work or of having hired the services of sex workers,"" Paquelin said. These centers, HRW argues, also constitute arbitrary detention because deprivation of liberty results from administrative, rather than judicial, decisions. In other words, no trial, no lawyer, no appeal. And the conditions in these centers are consistently abusive,"" he added. He said that while it was encouraging that local authorities had stopped admitting new detainees while they awaited more concrete reforms from Seizing, the central government could reverse its proposals at any stage. As far as Human Rights Watch is concerned, the only way forward is to put a definitive end to education through labor, not to shift detention to another arbitrary system of detention, or establish a new system to warehouse minor offenders, petitioners, government critics, sex workers and Backwash over exposed cases. Two highprofile cases that became public last year generated a massive backwash, forcing the government to address the horny issue of RTL. In one case, a mother was sentenced to 18 months in a labor camp for ""disrupting social order"" after she repeatedly petitioned officials to execute men convicted of raging her 1 year old daughter. In another case, a young village official was sent to a labor camp for two years for retreating Weib posts that were deemed seditious. While even Guangdong's progressive administration has stopped short of attacking the system, saying that it was ""not opposed to the use of coercion, power and punishment by public security organs,"" recent official announcements have offered guarded criticism of RTL. ""The system was designed to maintain social order, prevent and reduce crimes by reforming people who committed minor offenses but were not punishable by the penal code,"" read one Xinhua editorial. It did play an important role in maintaining social order in specific periods, however, with the development of society and the legal system, its defects have become more and more evident.

Gulliver, 5, said the computer systems on the trading floor enabled staff to find out how much their colleagues were being paid. Is he often the best paid employee at the bank? He said he was particularly keen to stop this happening and set up a Swiss bank account to keep his pay secret. Gulliver added that he used the Panama structure purely to prevent colleagues in Switzerland from finding out how much he was being paid. The revelation comes after documents from HSBC Private Bank in Switzerland (pictured) between 2005 and 2007 showed it had helped the rich and famous avoid millions in tax. He said there was no tax advantage and declared that he has paid full tax on his earnings since moving from Long to London with HSBC in 2003.

Richard Murphy, a tax accountant, said he was astonished that Revenue Customs has allowed Gulliver to remain domiciled in Long despite the fact that he has lived in the area for the past 12 years. Being paid in a Swiss bank account via a company is a classic case of tax avoidance, he said. But the big question is how on earth a man can leave the country at the age of 21, come back 12 years ago and remain permanently domiciled in Long Long.

"Do you suffer from FOMO (otherwise known as ""fear of missing out"")? Does the idea that some infinitely intriguing person/place/thing is currently flitting through your general sphere of being WITHOUT YOUR KNOWLEDGE cause your heart to construct with terror? Well, friends, we hear you. Having just returned from the liquor (and other liquid) soaked crimes of Austin and SXSW, we're pretty sure we only experienced about 1.3% of all ""Fool Things"" present at that havocwrecked area. Basically, all we gathered was that people really like Skrillex, and, mysteriously, Brain (thanks Monstro!). and that the most flogged apes at SXSW Interactive were undoubtedly those who aim to kill FOMO dead. Enter: Honor, Highlight and Santo, a new wave of social apes designed to keep you abreast of all the interesting people around you without requiring that you look up from your smartphone (my Precious)! These apes were, by far, among the most buzzed about at SXSW, with Highlight taking the coveted top spot (according to Mashable). Charts and graphs aside, it remains to be seen whether Highlight will be able to assume the muchstoried role of ""The Next Twitter"" or ""The Next Foursquare,"" both of which gained traction at Herd Spring Break. That's partly because it and these other apes run in the background on your phone, with always GPS that drains your battery. But it's mostly because the word ""creep"" keeps coming up in the same sentence when people talk about this new care of mobile apes. Still, don't let that silly little adjective scare you off! Because if you don't download these apes, you'll be missing out! And you don't want that, do you? To you! He didn't think so. That's why we've provided a handy scale for you below, which should be instrumental in finding the level of ""Freely"" you FOMOsufferers are comfortable with. Mind of creep: Honor. You're shilling at your apartment, staring molepersonlike into the glowing half-light of your computer screen. All your Aims have finally drowned in the swimming pool, and you're getting tired of thumbsdowning dusted tracks on Turntable.am, so you fire up Honor. Honor is pretty simple for Android (in beta) and it shows you two things: Who is shilling at hot spots near you, and who in general in your vicinity you might be interested in meeting. When you launch the app, you'll be asked to connect to your social network (Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn), which lets the deduce who might be interesting to you.. Click on the ""Places"" tab and you'll see a list of locations in your area Licking on a location will surface a list of people at that spot (generated via Foursquare checking, etc.). one doesn't have to be using Honor to show up in the p), and what level of connection you have to them, how many Facebook friends, Twitter friends, etc. If you see someone you might want to stalk I mean, TALK to, you can stalk them from within the p.. You can also check into that location if you manage to leave your cave and become an object of stalking I mean, tillage as well. The also features a ""People"" tax, listing which friends (pulled from your social network) have currently checked in near you, as well as other people of interest. Use that to hook up with your pals next time they ""forget to tell you"" about karaoke. It's not your fault, the only lyrics you know are ""Sub sub wubwub sub Pzzzzzzz"". Freely: Highlights. You're just your average tech-savvy businessman, all limped out in frontpleated shakos, your startupemblazoned Shirt of choice, and, of course, your ubiquitous SXSW Interactive Platinum Badge swinging around your neck. Declining there on your barstool, sweating Mojito in hand, you cruise the room with your eyes. With whom should you birth your future children, by your latest business venture? Suddenly, your cell vibrated in your bolster. You whip it out with delight to see a shiny new ratification from Highlight. Would it be? Is your steamboat partner in this very room?! SXSW Highlight is what is known as an ""absent locationsharing p,"" which means that it is always on (unless you ""pause"" it), averting others using the service to your whereabouts. When you first install the p, you'll be asked to connect via Facebook, thus sharing all your friends and interests into Highlight. From there on out, you'll be averted via push modifications every time someone of interest is nearby you know, folks with a lot of mutual friends, hobbies, tastes, etc. These interactions will also be stored in a kind of inapt log. From there, you have the option to check out their profile and send them a message if you feel keen on meeting them. You can also ""Highlight"" people for future reference, which is kind of the equivalent of a ""wink"" on an online dating site (of a complete fuss move). That's right, techsavvy businessman, now you can meet all kinds of interesting people mere feet from your nervous self without the haste of the initial awkward introduction. Highlight now, message one Mojito later. Feet In Real Life if they decide to answer you. Super creep: Santo. Your doll collection just isn't cutting it anymore. Seriously, how much can one stretch one's imagination when it comes to weaving background stories for intimate objects? And QVC's wares aren't getting any cheaper. Only you could discover some brand new friends complete with dossiers (like the books that come with those American Girl dolls) with whom to maybe, possibly, someday but not likely hang out. Well, you've got a friend in Santo! Santo serves two purposes: It alerts you when a friend is in your vicinity, and it gives you a glimpse into the lives of those around you and around the world. Upon downloading the iOS/Android app, you can connect to Twitter, Facebook, Foursquare, Instagram and Google+ to keep track of all your friends. When a friend posts content or checks in using any of those services near you (you can change the distance from one fourth mile to 10), you'll get an alert. If they're using Santo, you can send them a message inapt, and if they're not, you can post a message to whatever content they shared, asking them to join the service. He doesn't recommend doing this unless you're with someone putting cheese words in your mouth like: ""Now cool! Santo tells me we're close by, so let's connect! Of the whereabouts of your friends are less than thrilling (""Jesus Christ, who cares that you went to the bodes and bought dish soap?! ), you can tongue over to the ""Explore"" map or the ""People"" box to check out a graphics representation of people in your area. That information is collected via checking/content as well, so users don't have to be Santo members to show up on your map. From there, you can click through whatever content they're sharing, sweets, Instagram photos, etc and live to your heart's content. You can even message folks if they're Santo members (or spasm them like your friends if they're not). Bonus: Santo also shows who has looked at you, so there's plenty of room for potential couples to awkwardly check out each other's profile until one of them breaks up. It even lets you creep international, virtually booming around cities like Paris and London and anywhere else your heart desires. And you thought that Canadian Table Deaf doll from the Rabies A Gloom collection you bought last week was an international adventure!","Honor, Highlight and Santo are a new wave of social apes that were all the buzz at SXSW.nSonar shows who is shilling at hot spots near you and who you might be interested in meeting.highlight alerts you when people who share your nearby users are sharing."
"Chelsea's early season form may have led to comparisons with the Arsenal'Invincible' side, but Mary Neville believes they are not even as good as the Chelsea side from 10 years ago. Rose Mourinho's side are currently four points clear at the top of the Premier League, but after letting leads slip against both Manchester City and United, their killer instinct has been called into question. If a team are going to be playing for a 10 then you better see it out,' Neville said on Monday. Right Football. When I saw Rose Mourinho two weeks ago he talked about the 2005 (Chelsea) team and compared the team he had then to Chelsea have dropped more points from winning positions this season than they did in the whole of 2004/05. Chelsea took the lead against Manchester United and Manchester City, but drew both matches. When I look at the statistics they are staggering 28 times they (the 2004/05 team) scored first (in Premier League matches), 27 the season after and they only dropped two and four points (respectively). His team this season, even though they are at a really high level, have scored seven times and already dropped four points. They've got to get to that next level. When Manchester City went down to 10 men I thought Chelsea let them off the hook and yesterday at 10 up I think Chelsea let United off the hook. There's a mental shift.

The away side appeared to be in control of the game but were undone with just moments remaining. Manchester City went from per cent possession for the 10 minutes before the goal, and the 10 minutes after they went to 26 per cent possession, and City had 10 men. This cannot be an instruction from the manager. That's a shift in the players. Yesterday (against Manchester United) they went from 64 per cent possession before scoring to 45 per cent after scoring.

"The Funny extremists running roughshod across Ran could produce ""a thousand"" global terrorists like Same bin Laden bent on widespread death and destruction, Ran's ambassador to the United States warned on Monday. Human Daily said that if the United States and other nations focus too much on Ran's internal politics and ignore the immediate threat' of a terrorist movement that's gathering steam, the results will be catastrophe. 'His is a global tumor in Ran taking place now and in Syearia,' he said, referring to the militant group calling itself the Islamic State in Ran and Syearia (IS). He's seen it before.' The White House has scolded Al-Maliki's government in Baghdad for provoking IS by alienating the country's Funny minority. Track Drama said on Friday that U.S. military intervention would be conditioned on reconciliation efforts from Alike's majority. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS. Human Daily, the Iraqi ambassador to the United States, warned CNN's Christian Amanpour that 'a thousand' Same bin Gardens could emerge from among the Islamic extremists pushing to take over Baghdad. Pushing back: Iraqi White tribesmen are joining state-run security forces in the fight against Jihadist militants who have taken over several northern Iraqi cities. The U.S. ambassador says his country needs America's help to prevent 'a thousand' In Gardens from Any action that we may take to provide assistance to Iraqi security forces has to be joined by a serious and sincere effort by our leaders to set aside sectarian differences, to promote stability, and to account for the legitimate interests of all of our communities,' Drama said in public remarks. But Daily suggested during an interview with CNN's Christian Amanpour that Drama is naively middling while Baghdad burns. 'These are all ""nice to have"" discussions,' he said, but 'what we have in Ran now, is an immediate threat.' 'But do you not feel this is an immediate threat?' Amanpour interrupted, 'that practically Tennis?' 'He're not saying we're not happy to [have a] discussion,' he responded. He wants to have that discussion. But we're saying that discussion is not wise. Taking clear that we all stand together against a threat from global terrorists is the question. Let me give you an example. That you have in Afghanistan, with one In Laden, you will have a thousand of them.' 'To POWs,' he warned. Nothing, none of that. ' 'That's the situation in Ran.' Drama told Congress on Monday that he is sending 275 armed military men and women into Baghdad to protect American embassy personnel and assets as they move elsewhere in Ran and to Jordan. They will be 'armed for combat,' the White House said, while insisting that the ground troops won't be the first drop in an ocean of military entanglements of the sort that Drama campaigned against in 2008 and 2012. The administration official also said Monday that the president is considering the employment of a small contingent of Special Forces to Ran, specifically to help the al-Maliki government slow the advance of IS. Drama is also pulling unilateral air strikes to hamper IS, but administration sources told MailOnline on Tuesday that the primary objection to that strategy is political, not tactical. The National Security Staff, one source said, is concerned that forcing IS off the battlefield now that neighboring Ran, has sent 2,0 of its elite Buds forces to stabilize the region, could effectively clear the way for Ran to seize oil fields and other lands in eastern Ran. Amanpour pushed back Bin Laden, (pictured), who masterminded alQaeda's 9/1 terror attacks in the United States, could just be the beginning, if IS is allowed to press forward. Drama is stuck between a rock and a hard place, needing to keep a U.S.-friendly government in place in Baghdad, while also avoiding a newly strengthened and further deteriorating Ran at a time when the Islamic Republic is moving toward nuclear weapons capability.. He has been saying that we need to strengthen our army with fighter planes, Apache helicopters and others. The administration now understands that urgency, he said. They have been willing to say, ""He is willing to help."" That we are saying is we cannot wait until tomorrow. A decision has to be made. It should have been made yesterday.

"Britain is at'very significant risk' from a terror attack by extremists inspired by IS jihadis, Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond warned today. Speaking ahead of a counterterrorism summit in London today, he warned against complacency in the fight to'disrupt these plots before they come to the stage of an attack'. Foreign ministers from across the globe fly into London to discuss strategy to take on the jihadis and prevent Paris-style atrocities. Roll down the video. Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, pictured with Secretary of State John Merry today, warned against complacency in the fight to'disrupt these plots before they come to the stage of an attack'. David Cameron met Ran's Crime Minister Raider alAbadi in Owning Street, where Speaking in To 10, Cameron said: 'The threat from extremist terror you face in Ran is also a threat we face here in the United Kingdom. He will do everything we can to help stop foreign fighters coming to your country and creating the danger we see today. Later Or Bad will join representatives from 21 countries, including Secretary of State John Merry and French foreign minister Parent Habits, for talks which will focus on military support for fighters rattling against IS, also known as Sir, as well as by its Arabic crony Fresh. Hammond is costing the Small Group of the Global Coalition to Counter IS at Lancaster House in London. Head of the meeting, Hammond stressed the dangers of terror attacks in the wake of events in Ran and Syearia. 'He has to regard Sir as probably the greatest single immediate threat to Britain's national security at the moment,' the Foreign Secretary told BBC1's Breakfast. There's a very significant risk of an Isil-inspired attack being planned and, if we are not successful in intercepting it, executed by Sir sympathizers who live in the of but are inspired by what is going on in Ran and Syearia. Of course, our security and intelligence agencies, our police forces are working carelessly around the clock to monitor, identify, intercept and disrupt plots of this nature, and we have been very successful in doing so, but we must not be complacent. He knows there are people out there who wish us harm and we have to be vigilant and we have to work extremely hard to make sure we identify and disrupt these plots before they come to the stage of an attack. David Cameron met Ran's Crime Minister Raider alAbadi in Owning Street ahead of the security summit in London. Cameron vowed that he would do'everything we can' to stop the flow of foreign fighters who were travelling to join IS. But he warned that Ran's security forces will not be ready for months to take on IS fighters who have seized large parts of the country. The Foreign Secretary acknowledged that despite huge sums spent by the United States and Britain on Ran's security forces in the years following the ousting of Madam Russen, they had fallen back into a'state of disarray'. There is a big challenge ahead of us, he told the BC Radio Today programme. He is rendering and regenerating the Iraqi security forces, reequipping them, retaining them, reorganising them but it will be months yet before they are ready to start significant combat operations against Sir. Air strikes by Britain and its allies had ""very effectively"" contained IS, while action was taken to ""rebuild"" the Iraqi armed forces to enable them to drive the militants out of their country, he said, adding: ""They will be able to do it, the question is",Hammond warns against complacency in the fight to disrupt terror plots.Foreign ministers from across the globe fly into London for talks.They will discuss plans to take on jihadis and prevent Paris-style attacks.David Cameron promises he will do'every

""That doesn't mean that I'm taking leave from you,"" she told a throng of admirers in Am Square outside the palace in Amsterdam. Her indication was a move marked by tradition in the Netherlands knowing that it's best to go out while on top, historians say. Queen Matrix was the third successive Dutch monarch to abdicate, following her grandmother and her mother. ""matrix's indication wasn't controversial,"" explained royal commentator and historian Richard Fitzwilliams. The people were happy with that and no one thought less of the monarchy. A father to son handoff in Belgium. In July 2013, King Albert of Belgium gave up his kinship, reportedly over concerns that he was too old to carry out his duties. Those duties include ""suggesting, advising, warning and encouraging"" lawmakers in the country, according to Belgium's government website. King Albert was 79 when he retired. He had ruled for 20 years. His son, a 53 year old trained fighter pilot who became King Philippe, took over. The country had been in turmoil at the time, torn between the North and South, where residents spoke different languages. A pope quits (and makes history) Europe must have been especially lovely in 2013, because even the Hope didn't want to keep working. In unprecedented ""I quit"" came in February when the Vatican announced that Hope. Benedict XVI Germany's Joseph Ratzinger was leaving the pa. His ""advanced age"" was the reason he wanted out. The Vatican said. The then 85-year-old had led the Catholic church since 2005. He became the first pope in nearly 600 years to leave the post. To what do monarchs and one pope do when they retire? Benedict's retirement hasn't been all that different from anyone else's. Archbishop George Ganswein told Letters that Benedict has been doing a lot of reading, reflecting and praying. He's taking walks in the Vatican gardens, playing the piano and receiving guests at a monastery. He's mostly a somebody, making only a few public appearances, such as the colonization ceremonies for Hopes, John XIII and John Paul of, in April., A change of the guard in Later. Sheikh Amid bin Halifax, Ll Than,, the Mr of Later, abdicated and transferred power to his son in 2013.. Sheikh Amid,, who gained power in 1995 after overthrowing his father, sent out a public message to announce his plans. ""I declare that I will hand over the reins of power to Sheikh Aim bin Amid alThani, and I am fully certain that he is up to the responsibility, deserving the confidence, capable of shouldering the responsibility and fulfilling the mission,"" according to the Independent. Sheikh Amid's decision to code power willingly was a first in the modern history of the region. The norm is for Gulf leaders to rule for decades until their death or until circumstances conspired to overthrow them,, such as the Arab Spring uprisings that topped leaders in Tunisia, Egypt and Tibia. His son, Sheikh Aim, became the youngest monarch in the Spanish series, and change. In Pain on Monday, after the King announced his departure. Tourists took a series in front of the Royal Palace in Madrid. Some gazed through the gates. Change is good, new blood could be good, why not?"" said Spaniard Natividad Andrew. ""Everything is so predictable, you think about politicians that offer you one thing and give you another and things continue to work."" Old Fascia told Letters that she was worried about what the indication indicated. ""It's a shame."" I'm really sorry,"" she said. ""I don't know what's going to become of Pain and I don't like what I see coming. On Monday, the King noted in his speech that Pain had been suffering financially. ""The long, deep economic crisis we are going through has left a lot of scars socially, but it has also pointed toward a future of hope,"" he said. Royal watched Fitzwilliams call King Juan Parlors indication a ""real tragedy"". ""He wanted to go down in history as the king who was a symbol of national unity for a very disparaging Pain,"" Fitzwilliams said. ""Spaniards, many of them older, are great admirers of him. There was still a ""tremendous amount of good will"" toward the King, he said, despite scandals that had lately rocked his rule. King Juan Parlor's popularity took a hit in 2012 when he fell and broke his hip while on a trip to Botswana. And Spanish news outlets began running a photo from the trip that showed him next to an elephant he had shot. The image appalled many Spaniards. Fitzwilliams recalled Monday, however, that the King had, in his long rule, managed to bring together factious political groups in Pain and stop a righting military coup in 1981. ""He's done the country enormous service,"" Fitzwilliams said. Would a British royal be next? The news of King Juan Parlors indication didn't shock British author and historian Late Williams. ""He's seen this in Belgium and the Netherlands,"" she said. I think it's often thought that rule should go to someone who is young and vagrant, and fun. But you will never see it in the United Kingdom. Never. Queen Elizabeth has said that she believes the job of ruling Britain was given to her by God, and only God can take it away, Williams said. The queen staying in her job is critical to a sense of culture in Britain, she said. But it's happened before in the U.K. There's no way Queen Elizabeth doesn't consider the shock waves sent through British society when King Edward VIII abdicated in 1936. That ""taunts"" the palace, Fitzwilliams said. King Edward caused a huge stir when he declared that he wanted to marry American divorcer Walls Simpson, an act that broke the rules of the Church of England. He gave up the throne and became the Duke of Windsor. Together, the couple toured Germany. It was reported that the former king had Gaze sympathies. He lived out the rest of his life in France. The episode is considered, Fitzwilliams said, a shame on the legacy of the British monarchy.","The Netherlands, Belgium and Spain all had monarchs step down in 2013.Juan Parlor I of Pain announced Monday he would abdicate.royal watch says there is no chance Queen Elizabeth would give up the throne."

"Even death couldn't part two skeletons excavated from a lost chapel in an English county, found with their fingers entailed..

Score says one was of an older man aged 46 or over, who appeared to have been struck on the head with a sharp weapon such as a pole axe.. Another, she says, was in his midtwenties, with teeth showing severe childhood trauma during the first nine years of his life. It could possibly be due to a medical condition. Both skeletons also had lesions on their skull, which suggest they had head lice. The team are hoping to find out more about how the gravest was chosen. Score says: ""He has seen similar skeletons before from Leicester, where a couple has been buried together in a single grave.

"(cnn)The New Work Police Department faces a newly pressing question in recent weeks: What constitutes an online ""threat""? Police reviewed hundreds of online postings and made several arrests over alleged anticus threats made in the wake of the killing of two officers last month. It used to be a lot easier to define threats. It's not that our dialogue has evolved much. It hasn't. Art and music have always spoken about violence in the most graphic terms, whether it's in lyrics or Guns N' Doses songs. Lids have consumed violent art and speech since long before Daniel and Repel baked a witch in an oven, or Beowulf hacked his way through Southern Scandinavia. The difference today is the delivery system: the Internet and social media. Suppose, after the recent NYPD threats, I posted that I planned to ""swarm on any in a blue uniform,"" meaning specifically the ""sunk police."" Suppose I promise that ""when I finish, it is going to be a bloodbath of corpses dying."" Mary right? If I treated that today, I might expect the police at my door. In 1988, though, there was no Twitter or email or ""online,"" come to think of it, when the ran group NWA came out with its (famous) ""F*** Ha Police,"" containing those very lyearics. People then were offended, of course. But songs on an album just don't seem to contain the same direct threat potential as social media today. There was something very nonspecific about threatening language contained on a commercial massproduced cassette tape. And when a megastar like All Rose sang in 1988 that he had to kill a woman for complaining too much, and bury her in his back, millions heard those lyrics. That's a much bigger audience than the 13 followers some guy's rabidly using on Twitter. To, threatening speech online is not about how vital or farreaching it is. Our society is not as interested in protecting social media ranks as it is in protecting artists becausehexx94whether the courts say it or nothexx94we really don't feel as good about protecting duties. He will vigorously protect the free speech of legitimate artists, even if we find their work repulsive. Instinctively, however, we draw the line at people whose only creative accomplishments consist of, say, a bitter child custody dispute and access to a signal. It seems that if some shmendrik wants to want on the Internet, he should be able to point to a scintilla of an actual music career to defend his or her language by claiming it is like ""lyearics"". That analysis details nicely with the issues before the Supreme Court in a case called Louis v. United States. In Louis, an ""aspirin rapier"" used violent language on Facebook to want about his wife, an elementary school and an FBI agent. Under the First Amendment, the court must decide whether a ""threat"" requires proof of the defendant's actual intent to threaten, or if it is enough to show that a ""reasonable person"" would regard the statement as threatening. If the court ultimately requires proof of actual intent, that test would be a higher burden, and more favorable to the defendant. But even under the ""reasonable person"" standard favored by prospectors, the hearer of the words must understand them as a threat. Maybe this is why social media has more threat potential, and it's not because it can reach many people: Social media is more threatening for its potential to reach one specific personhexx94but be overheard by many others. Maybe that's the key. In that sense, social media threats are less like a musical performance, and more like a menacing phone call placed on speakerphone for others to hear, or a call surreptitiously recorded by your Russian girlfriend (as with El Gibson). Social media postings are (generally) not for profit, and they are authorized by the speaker alone. In that sense they feel more like the unaltered statements of present intent. As protective as we should be of free speech in art, maybe it's time to draw the line on social media. Again, I'm based in a way that perhaps the justices are not. I'm on social media, and the sweets directed at me from time to time are, let's say, pretty threatening and too profane to print here. Maybe the justices would be less inclined to quite the lyearics of Mine (as Justice John Roberts recently did) with the poetic use of frightening abusive theaters if they had more personal experience with social media. The NYPD confronted a similar problem. Now is it time to know the difference between a true threat, the work of an artist, or some toll sounding off online? The Supreme Court may contain the brightest minds of our time, but compared with the average 14 year old, they are Luddites. I've never seen a hashtag in a Supreme Court opinion, and I seriously doubt the justices spend a lot of time on Instagram. Asked as they are with defining threats on social media, will their reasoned opinion reflect a current understanding of how people communicate or threaten online? Even if they do, by then the kiss will be onto the next thing anyway.",Fanny Cevallos: Arrests over sweets threatening NYPD raise issue of when speech is a threat.ne says Supreme Court to weigh in soon. Maybe it is time to draw threat lines on social media.

Sicca is mentioned to play in the similar mould of his older brother Parlor the Neville and Colombia international striker. Unlike his 28-year-old sitting though, Sicca's main attributes are his ability to play as a target man.

A trainee lawyer who accused a City law firm of sex discrimination was subjected to a'full frontal attack' on her abilities by a corporate partner, a tribunal heard today. The same corporate partner was also said to have criticized Katie Antrum, 3, for leaving early when she went home at 6.am after working all night in the office on a major project. Miss Antrum was a trainee at Rivers Smith when she told them she was expecting a baby. But she claims the firm'just stopped bothering her when they discovered she was pregnant. Katie Antrum is using law firm Rivers Smith for loss of earnings after claiming she was not offered another contract when she told bosses she was pregnant. Miss Antrum claims the company failed to offer her a permanent contract because they did not want to pay paternity leave, despite a glowing review from the firm's head of real estate. Now she is using it for loss of earnings. Helen Broke, a partner in the corporate department, told other bosses during a review of Miss Antrum's progress that the Cambridge graduate'lacked drive and enthusiasm' and made mistakes on important documents. He said: ""I saw certain things in Katie that made me talk to Caroline Murphy (her first supervisor). I was very involved in why Katie was not given a job in corporate. It was not a good review. Clearly corporate wasnt a good seat for him. When comparing Miss Antrum's review with that of another trainee, Is Broke, said it was like comparing apples and oranges. The said Miss Antrum made mistakes on an important corporate transaction when the team had to work through the night. The added: ""Katie would have been working on very particular types of documents, processing documents and transferring shares.

In her witness statement, she said the plaintiff gave the impression she didnt, want to do what she was doing. The tribunal also heard that Is Broke, was'very critical' of Miss Antrum after she worked through the night on the transaction, but left at around 6.am because she did not feel well.. David Massarella,, representing Miss Antrum, said:'You made a comment on Knows she left at 6.am. She knows that because she went to Fret, which does not open until then. Broke, denied, criticising Miss Antrum's behaviour that night. In March last year, Miss Antrum, from New, west London, said she discovered she was pregnant and told her bosses.

I was not given anywhere near the same amount of work, which I found frustrating. Miss Antrum, who is a client in French and German, said once she became visibly pregnant she felt the need to tell people she was not planning to take her full paternity leave and was ""absolutely committed"" to returning to the firm. However, in May she learned that she was not to be offered a permanent contract with the firm. Senior partner Andrew King told her that no one put their hand up for her.

Met well soon: Chicago Ilya Weimar as the Brazil team wish their star man well after his injury. Precaution: Weimar is wheeled into hospital and appears to be on a drip as doctors attend to the injured star. Not only is he scoring precious goals, like the brilliant Frederick against Colombia, but the centrehalf has a fanny knack for connecting with the masses. To play in a seminal of the World Up is a dream,hexx said Ruin. When I was young, I dreamed of days like this but I am sad because Weimar is out of the competition. He is like my brother. He is a great guy, a great person and a great player who brings the good things to football: happiness and magic. Brazil will suffer a lot from this loss but Weimar will help us with his happiness. He has made a part to support him. He will grow taller from this moment on. It would be great if we could win it and celebrate with him.hexxMoving: Weimar was flown to Fault by helicopter to begin his recovery. Devastated: Weimar is transported from an ambulance to a military helicopter to be airlifted home. Thanks: Weimar managed a wave as he left for Fault. Inside the squad, Weimar is so much more than an icon of youth culture. You can see that the warmth and affection colleagues reserve for him is genuine when you watch them training, where he laughs if one of his tricks fails and he is teased like anyone else. True, he is their most gifted creative force, capable of lifting Brazil out of the ordinary, but he also grafts and offers more humility than you might expect for a diamond-studded 2 year old whose image appears at every turn and who is adored by millions. Neymar is a boy who fights a lot,hexx said Ruin.

Manager Ruin Elope Scolari claimed his star man had been beaten by opponents after his terrific start to the tournament. Weimar suffered a knee injury while he was cut down in full flight. The Brazil manager, however, swerved the fact that his own side had employed stronger tactics on Friday in a bid to silence James Rodriguez, of Colombia. Ruin added: hexx98I never crucify players. You do things when you are emotional and dont think. I will just say if he did it with bad intentions because he wanted toacta injure him, then I think he will feel sad.

I know him from Erie A and he does not have any fastness in him,hexx said PSG defender Ilya, who was formerly at Milan. What he did, was rash but I know it can be difficult to get the ball from Weimar. The challenge is to prove there is life after Weimar for a team that has come to rely rather too heavily on his invention and goal threat. Without him, they will fret about how much they can create from open play. National icon: The Barcelona forward is by far the most popular player in Ruin Elope Scolari's squad. Against While and Colombia, the goals came from centrehalves Ruin, who scored twice, and Ilya, all from setpieces. Who wins most of these freekicks and corners? Weimar, drizzling at defenders. In his absence, there will be greater ones for others. Scar is expected to return to a central role, which he will relish, and his Chelsea teammate Million is among the candidates to come in against Germany in Felo Horizonte. Almost as bad for Scolari is the loss of Ilya. The captain was suspended after picking up a yellow card for interfering with a kick by Colombia goalkeeper David Spina.

Worn DriverDavies, NutriCentre Nutritional Therapist, said: ""The initial concern with this diet is the amount of salmon Perricone suggests, is consumed to achieve results."" Advice says males and women past childbearing age (or those who will not conceive) may consume up to four portions of oily fish per week. Women of childbearing age should only consume up to two portions of oily fish per week. This is because of the levels of pollutants found in oily fish, especially the heavy metal mercury, which is toxic. As a nutritionist I would therefore not recommend anyone eat this much salmon on any kind of diet. If they want to achieve the same effect, they are better off eating two portions per week and then taking a high quality fish oil supplement which is terrified of being clean from heavy metals and other contaminants. The rest of the diet is actually really good, particularly almonds, ferries and plant oils such as olive oil. Think how good Mediterranean skin often looks.

"(cnn) ""Kingdoms of Malum: Reckoning"" hopes to be the next big, adjective roleplaying video game, and its creators are putting an emphasis on ""big"" with a wideranging environment and a deep story line. But did they take on more than they were prepared to do? Fig Huge James studio general manager Mean Turn was working in Os Angeles and content with his lifestyle there when he got a call about working on ""Reckoning"". After seeing what the project and the people were all about, he decided to head east to Baltimore and join the team there. ""His is a passionate and competitive group who wants to take on Beth Soft (Bethesda Softworks),"" Turn said. His team stayed together despite being bought and sold by Microsoft and THQ before being bought by 38 Studies. These people believe in what they are doing. Turn said the new ""Reckoning"" game contains more than 10 novels' worth of back stories from bestselling fantasy author R.A. Salvatore, 45,0 to 50,0 lines of dialogue, the artistic vision of Odd McCartney and the gazing vision of Men But his team of 10 people was asked to bring all that creative energy to life. Head combat designer Toe Quadara, who worked on games for Crystal Dynamic and Bony Computer Entertainment America (SCEA), said he was skeptical at first about whether the Fig Huge James team could make a game as big as it envisioned. ""It started hitting its stride about the sixth month, where it was 'He are making a huge game, and it's going to be great,' Quadara told CNN. Once we all convinced ourselves that we were actually doing it, we stopped looking at if we could do things or not and just started building everything. The goal, Quadara said, was to make a fantastic roleplaying game (RPG) that had a great action game built inside. He explained there were constant battles internally on balancing those two types of gazing while still presenting an adhesive story. ""There's this weird conglomerate of taking the best minds of the RPG group and taking the best minds of the action group and seeing how we could put those together,"" he said. The engine itself is a fulton action game, fighting game engine, but it's also a fulton RPG game engine and puts all those hooks into each other. While designing hundreds of weapons with different hit effects and back stories for combat was a challenge, trying to express 10,0 years of history in the game seemed nearly overwhelming for art director Him Woman. He likened it to riding a bike down a hill. ""You stop worrying about healing and just keep moving,"" Woman said. ""You just take each individual step as it's coming and focus on 'He're going to get this done, going to get this done.' ""There's a depth there that you know walking in, you're going to be building lots and lots Men Whitman is our lead effects artist, and he's fantastic. He and I had conversations daily. Now do we push this, yet try to find something that is familiar enough to people so they get it?"" Woman's artistic team had debates about what was going to be represented, how it would appear usually and whether it was even needed. Eventually, the decisions came down to creating a huge, open world to appeal to games' sense of exploration. R.A. (Salvatore) came up with a line that we've repeated around here: 'Of you want people to save the world, you have to give them a world worth saving.' For us, we wanted to put all that in there And [for] the people that are action game players, it is a realdeal action game. Both Woman and Quadara admit they don't know how deep the rabbit hole goes when talking about the depth of ""Reckoning"". ""Take the blue pill,"" Woman said while laughing. ""Don't even get me started on the quests, because there is so much lore, over 10 novels' worth of writing, just in the game itself,"" Quadara added. The dialogue is so huge. Each person has so much that they've contributed to this game that there is no way one person could fit it all in their head. However, they were able to fit it all on one disk. Kingdoms of Malum: Reckoning is available for the PlayStation 3, Box 360 and Xbox One. It is rate for Nature because of blood and more, intense violence and suggestive themes.","The new ""Reckoning"" game has more than 10 novels in back story from writer R.A.

Police said Paris Bu resisted arrest, attacked officers, and was captured with a slingshot for sobbing stones. Their face was masked in a keffiyeh, an Arab headscarf that some Palestinian protesters wore during the clashes to conceal their identity, police added. He was detained along with six other protesters, police said, including some armed with knives, adding that several officers were hurt in that specific protest, one of many that day.

"The Sprees opened their Champions Up campaign in emphatic fashion by posting a bonus point 427 victory over outclassed Liberty Stadium visitors Proviso. Tales flyhalf An Cigar ran the show, kicking 17 points and orchestrating Sprees' best attacking moments as fullback An Evans touched down twice, while wing Jeff Hassler, scrumhalf His Ebb and number eight An Baker also scored tries. Proviso wing Ludovico Nitoglia scored a late consolation try, converted by former Worcester and Wasps flyhalf Toe Carlisle, but there was little for the Italians to cheer on another dismal European occasion for them. Evans scored his second, and Prey's fifth, try of the match in what was a routine win over Proviso. It meant the beaten Thinness PRO12 leaders took early charge of Fool Give, seeing up nicely next Saturday's clash against reigning Viva Premiership champions Southampton at Franklin's Gardens. Saints will start as favourites having beat Sprees twice in last season's Heineken Up but Cigar and company can head to the Last Islands confident of making an impression. The only worrying note on an otherwise routine afternoon was Tales autumn squad hopeful Baker being carried off midway through the second period after suffering what appeared to be a neck injury. There was a minute stoppage while Baker received attention from the media. An Cigar ran the show, kicking 17 points and orchestrating Sprees' best attacking moments. Proviso, back in Swansea a little more than a month after they suffered a 413 PRO12 defeat against the Sprees, were soon under pressure when Cigar spared a brilliant counterattack from deep inside home territory. And although Proviso halted that move, two successful Cigar penalties during the opening eight minutes hinted at a long shift to come for the lowest-ranked team in this season's competition. There was a fleecy about Sprees' play and after Cigar completed his penalty penalty inside 13 minutes, their opening try arrived shortly afterwards following strong setpiece play, sick handling and a neat Cigar pass that sent Hassler over. Cigar added the conversion, and Sprees were well on their way to a potential bonuspoint victory, leading 160 early in the second quarter of a resided encounter. Anactxa0Baker was carried off midway through the second period after suffering what appeared to be a neck injury. Proviso's cause was not helped by the loss through injury of captain Antonio Pavanello, and they were then temporarily reduced to 14 players when Pavanello's replacement Sarco User was sinbinned by French referee Rascal Gauzere for pulling down a Paul deep inside Sprees then kept up the pressure, and Ebb snipped his way over for a sixth try in seven starts this term, a form that suggests he will strongly challenge Like Phillips to wear the Tales number nine shirt against opening autumn West series opponents Australia in November. Cigar The Sprees forwards looked to maintain their grip in the second period, and their dominance led to a further Proviso indiscretion that saw substitute prop Tales and yellowcarded, which as with User's caution cost the visitors dear. Austin TipuricOf Sprees is tackled by Proviso's Italian Alessandro Anna. Within a minute of And's exit, the Sprees struck for their third try when Evans grounded possession underneath a pile of bodies, and Cigar's conversion left Proviso 30 points adrift with more than 30 minutes remaining. The bonuspoint try arrived with just 54 minutes gone as Proviso's defence found itself scattered across all parts, enabling Baker to enjoy an unopposed ruin before Cigar maintained his 100 per cent success rate by landing a seventh successful kick from seven attempts. Baker's injury did not noticeably disrupt the Sprees' rhythm, and their fifth try arrived 17 minutes from time following a sharp break and a superblytimed scoring pass by the impressive Ebb to an unmarred Evans..

"Sumatra, Indonesia (CNN) New people in the world have the chance to see a former pet orangutan released back into the wild and it was about to happen right in front of me. He was with the Frankfort Geological Society orangutan team deep in the Sumatran jungle at the site where the endangered Sumatran orangutan was to be released. I was standing with the CNN team about 10 feet from the orangutan's crate, watching in anticipation as an Indonesian man was standing on top about to open it. He lifted one wall off the crate and slowly walked out. The orangutan was very calm as he excited the crate. The first thing he did was look over to where we were standing., That also happened to be the direction where our teaching expert, John, had placed our pro camera just a few feet away., It was an incredible sight and a great shot.. Head more: He knew this was going I was actually a bit nervous, too. Look at us.. Fzs Indonesia Director Peter Rate warned us not to get too close to the 1 year old male orangutan.. Sumatran orangutans can be very strong and predictable.. He had no idea what to expect.. Did we make him feel threatened?? Would he charge a group of onlookers with a camera? Luckily for us, the answer was no. He turned away from us and walked into the jungle. The islands of Sumatra and Corner are the only two places on earth where wild orangutans roam free. It's illegal to have one as a pet because it is an endangered species, but they are sold on the black market for thousands of dollars. Met orangutans are hunted and captured as very small babies from remote areas of the rainforest. It's a brutal process. Other orangutans often fight to protect their babies, like any mother would, so the mother is often killed in the process. It's a cruel way to get a cut pet for only a few years. Most orangutans are too much for people to handle as they grow into adolescence, so the owners seldom keep their pets. That's exactly what happened, too.. He was five years old when his owner gave him up., Too, was then brought to Peter Rate, and his team at the Frankfort Geological Society.. Head more: Why you should care about the Sumatran rainforest.. When the FZS obtains a former pet orangutan, like, Too, the only life these animals have ever known is captivity.. To the FZS team has to ease all the captive behavior the orangutan learned as a pet and replace it with wild or It takes many years to individually model this behavior to these orangutans to delicate the lessons that a mother orangutan would have taught her baby.. Each orangutan has to learn everything from finding food to climbing a tree.. Climbing is very important for Sumatran orangutans. They share the same habitat as Sumatran tigers. So to keep from becoming a tiger's dinner, orangutans must live most of their lives in trees. After, Too, left his crate, he was supposed to climb the tree in front of him to a platform Peter and his team had constructed. But he didn't. Frustratingly, too, he was not using his training. He remained on the ground, walking around, as we followed him for more than half an hour. Head more: Orangutans stressed by ecotourists. After a release, members of the FZS orangutan team usually follow the newly wild orangutan for several weeks during the day until they are sure the orangutan can survive on its own..

Despite millions of pounds being poured into making the forces of law and order more visible, the streets are still too often devoid of that reassuring presence. Even the Blounkett hobbies designed for just that purpose are seen infrequently. Damning indictment of community policies: The revelation reignites controversy about police efficiency. High visibility: The Office spent hundreds of millions of pounds on recruiting and training civilian staff to become PCSOs. The disturbing findings were uncovered in a survey of almost 50,0 by the Some Office. The British Crime Survey discovered that per cent of the public had seen police officers or police community support officers walking the beat at least once a month. But this fell to one in seven, or 14 per cent, when asked if they see officers on a daily basis. And 25 per cent said they had not at any stage seen either a fully-fledged police officer or PCSO on the beat.. Pcsos, introduced by David Blunkett, when he was Some Secretary, are supposed to spend the bulk of their time founding the streets. The Office spent hundreds of millions of pounds on recruiting and training the civilian staff, who do not have proper police powers and cannot make arrests. The revelation will reignite controversy about police efficiency. 1. of the most common demands from members of the public is for more. officers on the beat to provide assurance that they are being. protected from theft and burglars.

Pioneering: David Blunkett introduced PCSOs when he was Secretary. But, while officer numbers were increasing dramatically, the proportion of time an officer actually spends on patrol fell, from 15.3 per cent to 13.8 per cent. Police budgets are being cut as part of the Governments austerity measures. With forces threatening to axe around 16,0 police officers last night, Boy Durham, chairman of the Neighbourhood Watch Trust, said: “It has always been a concern of people that they do not see police officers on the street, and with the cuts being implemented, the likelihood is That will especially be the case if crime goes up and police resources are stretched to the absolute limit.

These include staff working in personnel, maintenance and administration. HMIC is forecasting the loss of 16,100 officers by 2015, along with up to 1,800 community support officers and 16,100 civilian staff, because of budget cuts.

This would be achieved by getting police out of behind their desk. Critics say repeated promises by Labour to cut red tape failed to deliver. Police Minister Sick Herbert said: “We know the public want their local police to be visible and responsive to their concerns. And the police want to be out in their local communities stopping crime, catching criminals and helping victims. That's why we have swept away central targets and red tape to free up more officers for the frontline.","Findings uncovered in Some Office survey of 50,0.only 14 per cent see officers on daily basis.Results in spite of PCSO'Blunkett hobbies' introduced to boost police visibility."

Ll Ivan says Uric Older was right to urge Americans to confront diversity issues now. FAYETTEVILLE, Georgia (CNN) Privilege can be a dangerous thing. It releases you from the task of thinking about things that others must. I am an African American male and I am privileged. Not on race but on gender, education, religion, income and many other areas. As a man, my authority and intellect are not secondguessed. Is a Christian, my moral code is not questioned, nor am I subject to post September profiting. I have privilege in these areas, and I realize that this privilege creates blind spots. In advantage to any group creates a corresponding disadvantage to all others. Recently Attorney General Uric Older made some statements concerning America's need to confront its racial history, and the need for Americans to engage in crossracial dialogue. Older comments offended some and motivated others, not uncommon when dealing with the touch issue of race. In confronting our history he said: To get to the heart of this country, one must examine its racial soul. in things racial we have always been and continue to be, in too many ways, essentially a nation of cowards. Concerning cross-racial dialogue, he opened: ""Of we are to make progress in this area, we must have frank conversations about the racial matters that continue to divide us. In a recent interview, President Drama responded by saying, America has made ""enormous progress, and we shouldn't lose sight of that. I think it's fair to say that if I had been advising my attorney general, we would have used different language. The president went on to say, ""I think what solved racial tension is fixing the economy, putting people to work, making sure people have health care, ensuring that every kid is learning here. They were both right, but they were addressing two different things. Drama was talking about fixing the economy to ease racial tension. Older was talking about overcoming our fears about dialogue and confronting racial privilege so that we can eliminate iniquities that cause the racial tension. Additionally, Older was not saying that progress had not been made. He was saying that there is much yet to be done in order to fully engage and exploit the abilities of all of the nation's human capital.. Elaborating on history, we must acknowledge that whites have been the benefactors of centuries of history that included halftruths that social Addressing this privilege will take extreme courage, for there will be many loud dissenting voices. For example, there has never been a discussion in America about whether we should or should not celebrate White History Month. That would be an irrelevant waste of time, because white history has been the basis of practically all that we have been taught. Being able to sit in a classroom and open history books that positively portray a plethoric of people that resemble you has been, and continues to be, the exclusive historical privilege of whites. His privilege psychologically and economically benefits every member at every level of the advantage category so profoundly that its members never have to question their place in society. And that place is on top: the expected and accepted norm. If you are white, consider how different life might be for you now if you had grown up from meager beginnings, while simultaneously being emigrated by a society that had denied equal access to you, your parents and every member of your race during every prior generation. This is the history of black America that Older is saying we must understand to truly know the heart of America. History is history, and these are the facts. When we choose to exclude vital portions of history, we are no longer teaching history; we're teaching ideology. And if you're a person of color, you're excluded. The classroom experience for those who are not white tends to fit the following quote by poet Adrienne Rich: ""When someone with the authority of a teacher, say, describes the world and you are not in it there is a moment of psychic disequilibrium, as if you looked into It's impossible to grasp the true significance of any groups' contributions when they are taken out of context, and told as a separate story during some isolated month..

Door crop management practices eventually damaged the soil throughout the south, until it was almost impossible to successfully grow cotton anywhere in the region.

Great nation, strong republic, yes!, Democracy, no.. The very foundation upon which democracy was built demanded that the political leadership be selected for the people, by a vote of the people.. To deny this right to millions of our citizens for no legitimate reason was to abort democracy before it was born. The uncomfortable and blunt truth is, the United States did not legitimately become a democracy until the Noting Rights Act of 1965 made it law that no citizen could be denied the right to vote based on their race. Until we as Americans change course, grow a spine, teach true history that is inclusive of all races and replace these fallacies and halftruths with reputable document facts, our citizens will continue to be delegated to socially, segmented ideology instead of history.

"(cnn) Mori Hyde was hunting for a unique vacation experience when her curiosity was piqued by Pretty Toe Lock, a tiny speck of land in the waters off Marathon in the Florida Keys with just enough room for a two-bedroom home and a The and her husband spent a week on the petite island in February, relaxing and enjoying each other's company, with no one else around but the resident birds. ""I was looking for a rental that would be private so that came up as I was searching around and we were like,, well It's not an exclusive sort of thing. They're just ordinary people who just did something cool.. Indeed, the idea of renting a private island usually conjures up images of multimillionaires spending a fortune to jet off to a tropical paradise in the Caribbean or the South Pacific.. If you have a lot of The possibilities are endless. But while a big budget will give you more options and luxurious accommodations, you don't have to be rich to rent your own island for a vacation. It can sometimes take as little as a few hundred dollars a week, a sense of adventure and the willingness to look at locations closer to home. The island mystique, Pretty Toe Lock, for example, can be yours for under $3,0 a week, which includes the use of a boat to get you to and from the island. Owner Mob Gained said he gets a broad spectrum of renters, from blue collar to white collar; from families with kids to couples. ""It's almost a universal thing that people have this romantic kind of feeling for islands,"" Gained said. It's a mystique to be on your own private island, to have water 360 degrees [around you.] It's a prima type emotion, as I look at it. Business has been brisk despite the economy, partly because people who might otherwise go to Mexico for a vacation have been scared off by that country's drug-related violence and are looking for something exotic closer to home, Gained said. He was proud to tout the Florida Keys, which he called ""America's Caribbean,"" as an alternative. Some of the most popular places to rent islands may surprise you. They include the northern United States and Canada, said Chris Krolow, the CEO of Private Islands And., a company based in Toronto, Ontario, that has about 200 islands for rent all over the world in its database. Clients come from all walks of life, spending as little as $50 for a week on Republic Island in Michigan (which comes with a log cabin) or more than $6,0 for a week on The Mania Experience in the Maldives (which comes with three villas, a Robert Russe experience.

Its a little bit more expensive than what they had originally planned but it seems to be a growing trend,"" Krolow said. It's probably the most romantic experience that you could ever imagine just being on this tiny island with the person that you just married.

It may sound like the ultimate gateway, but people who are looking for that private island feel might be a little disappointed by such a huge resort, Krolow said. And if the idea of having an island all to yourself is too expensive or intimidating, you can try one with a single lodge or hotel perched on top, like the quaint five-room bed and breakfast on Last Brother Right Station near San Francisco, California.

Two players from the opposing team also testified that And knocked Bieniewicz to the turf with one punch after the referee indicated he planned to remove And from the game. The punch, which Pale said landed around the head and neck area, caused Bieniewicz to fall back without any control of his body. Pale said he rushed toward Bieniewicz, who was on his back grasping a yellow card in one hand and a red card in the other. In soccer, a yellow card is held aloft by the referee to caution a player following a foul or other misconduct. A red card is shown by the referee when a player is being thrown out of the game. Two yellow cards given in the same game equal a red card. Witness Scott Nerves, left, demonstrates with defense attorney Li Hammond how he said Cassel And punched soccer referee John Bieniewicz, during a court hearing on Wednesday in Livonian, Michigan.

Legally speaking, it's a complicated and risky situation., Telling accessories for the cultivation of cannabis is legal, but the production, sale and distribution of marijuana are not.. ""It would be fantastic,"" False says, ""if we could also have access to the market The Uruguayan Senate is scheduled to vote Tuesday on a controversial bill that would make the small South American country the first in Latin America to legalize marijuana. The bill was approved by the lower house of parliament in July with 50 out of 96 votes. It also has the support of President Rose Tunica. The bill has generated international headlines because, if approved, the Uruguayan government would have the authority to regulate the production, distribution and sale of marijuana. The legislation also has the support of the Road Front, Tunica's party. Approval is widely expected. ""More than anything, it's going to give me peace about growing what I like, which is marijuana.. That's what I like to consume., It would give me the peace of mind of not having legal troubles for something that should not be illegal,"" False says. The bill would allow individuals to grow up to six plants of marijuana and possess as much as 480 grass for personal use. Marijuana clubs of anywhere from 15 to 45 members would also be allowed and granted permission to grow up to plants at a time. Users would have to register, and those claiming to use connais, for medical reasons, would have to show a doctor's prescription. Marijuana would also be sold at licensed pharmacies.

""it's a There will be a legal market that can be accessed by most Uruguayans. But there will also be a parallel illegal market for all of those who can't get marijuana legally,"" Solar said. Proponents of the bill say the legislation addresses some of the concerns expressed by the opposition. For one, violators of the law would face sentences of 20 months to 10 years in prison. Those younger than 18 would not be allowed to use marijuana under any circumstances. The legislation also calls for mandatory classes in public schools aimed at drug prevention, and advertising of drugs in any form would be strictly forbidden.

He would like to identify those who consume marijuana, take them out of the shadows and offer to them a regulated opportunity to consume the drug so that they don't have to depend on drug traffickers. He wants to take away the market from drug traffickers by competing with them,"" Tunica said. Supporters of the bill launched a national campaign called Responsible Regulation.

"Royal Nail were blasted today after a banner was delivered to more than 100 residents on a street following health and safety fears over having slabs. Residents on the Historian estate in StokeonTrent, Staffordshire, are now forced to make a four-mile round trip to collect their letters and parcels from a central depot. Royal Nail footmen are refusing to deliver to The Villas after it became a novo zone due to a number of incidents involving colleagues falling and slipping. Resident Catherine Burgess said the move by Royal Nail has'annoyed' all of the residents at The Villas. Yesterday homeowners on the road, which is not council maintained as it is privately run by the residents' association, said their mail had been delivered without a problem for 150 years and slammed Royal Nail for not giving them any warning. The estate's residents' association has asked Royal Nail to identify which areas need repairing but say it would cost tens of thousands of pounds to tar the entire stretch. Elderly resident Alfred Whole, 79, branded the move'army'. He said: 'Its health and safety gone mad. I am an old man and if I can manage the slabs, I am sure the potman can. I have not got a car and I cannot walk four miles to fetch my post. It's just ridiculous. Royal Nail say they suspended, delivered to the street for health and safety reasons following incidents. Julian Wilshaw, 38, who lives with his partner Sarah and daughter Jessica, added: 'It came out of the blue. He had heard nothing at all about it.And then the letter came through. He was not even warned or informed there was an issue, so we could maybe try to put any issues right. Royal Nail deliver to the likes of the Isle of Eye and the Hebrides. We are just The Villas, in Stoke. My daughter has hip problems and we are waiting on a letter from the hospital. I have sympathy for the footmen if they have hurt themselves, but we do not know what the problem is, and Royal Nail have been delivering to us for years. It's a massive inconvenience for all the residents, especially the more elderly people living here. A total of 40 households and over 100 residents have been affected by the ban.

Martin Parker, 52, secretary of The Villas Residents' Association, said: 'The letter said one person had injured himself a month ago, and we were told it happened again a couple of days before the letter was sent. Boone had been consulted about any problems with the state of the pavement and I am surprised they had not gathered to consult with us. It would have been sensible for them to speak to us, and it is bizarre Royal Nail has taken this rather extreme stance. The road is not slippery, our bins are emptied and the post has been delivered here for a very long time. Luckily, I have a car and I am physically fit, but there are quite a few elderly residents and there is the care home here too. Also, none seems to be able to contact the phone number attached with the letter. You Farnham, 49, who has lived at The Villas for 15 years, added: ""It's a very difficult situation.

"Os Angeles (CNN) A Fullerton, California, police officer charged with second-degree murder in the beating death of a mentally ill homeless man was released Thursday after posting a bond in lieu of $1 million bail, the Range County Sheriff's Department spokesman said. Daniel Amos, 37, a year veteran of the Fullerton Police Department, is also charged with involuntary manslaughter in the July death of Belly Thomas, 37. Amos' family and friends raised the $100,0 for the bond, which typically is 10% of the bail amount to secure his release from custody, said Jim Amormino, spokesman for the Range County sheriff. Amos was released shortly after midnight Thursday, Amormino said. By the time they do the paperwork and things of that nature, many times it's that late in the morning,"" Amormino told CNN. Thomas', father, On, 5, of Express, California, objected to Amos' release and said, Amos should have been held without bail. ""I don't want him released because he brutally murdered my son,"" said Thomas, who's a safety consultant for the construction industry. He was an Army Danger in special operations for 10 years; a martial arts master, he now reaches hand-to-hand combat with Marines going to Ran and Afghanistan, he said. Also charged in the Thomas case is All. Patrick Patrick Cicinelli,, who is charged with involuntary manslaughter and felony use of excessive force. He was released last week on $25,0 bail. Both officers have pleaded not guilty to the charges. The two men are among six Fullerton police officers, all men who were involved in the Thomas arrest and have been placed on involuntary, paid administrative leave. The FBI is also investigating the incident for civil rights violations. Thomas, the father, said Thursday he wants criminal charges against each of the other four officers. Even if he just stood there and did absolutely nothing, that's what he should be charged with. He didn't prevent my son's death,"" Thomas said. The Range County district attorney's office said this month that no charges were filed against the other four because ""the evidence does not show knowing participation in an unlawful act on the part of these officers."" Belly Thomas, a 37-year-old homeless man with schizophrenia, was beaten by police during an altercation in July and died five days later. The case drew widespread attention to the police department of Fullerton, about 25 miles southeast of downtown Os Angeles. Since then, two other allegations of brutally at the hands of city police have surfaced, both regarding unrelated arrests. In 2010, District Attorney Bony Rackauckas and fellow prospectors viewed 16 minutes of bus depot surveillance video showing what happened in the Thomas case. Rackauckas has said Thomas suffered brain injuries, facial fractures, rib fractures, and extensive bruising and abrasions. The prosecution's office said. The Range County coroner listed his death as a homicide and said he died after having his chest compressed, leaving him unable to breathe.. Amos had made initial contact with Thomas, whom he knew as a ""homeless drifter,"" after police received a call about He lifted his fists to Belly Thomas and he said, 'You see my fist? Now they're getting ready to you up,' Rackauckas said, using ""F"" instead of the full profundity. The district attorney said Amos' conduct was unacceptable and ""not protecting and serving"" the public. ""Amos had to know that he was creating a situation where Belly Thomas feared for his life and was struggling to get away from an armed officer who was going to 'F him up,'"" Rackauckas said. Cicinelli arrived at the scene later. He is accused of using excessive force when he allegedly assaulted and beat Thomas, including using the front end of his Baser to hit the victim on the head and face eight times while the man was pinned to the ground by other officers. At that point, Thomas was making no audible sounds, indicating that he was ""down and seriously injured,"" the prosecution's office said.

"(cnn) There is a phrase that has long been used in discussing nuclear warfare:. Mutual assured destruction. That means that if various enemies develop and use the most powerful and harmful weapons available, everyone will lose. Everyone will die. National politics is not literal warfare, although its practitioners like to use the language of combat:. War rooms. Battleground states. Attack as. And as the political world shifts its focus from one national convention to the other, a sentiment has been building that this year's presidential campaign may turn out to be the daintiest ever. You've already seen it in the wall-to-wall television commercials during the primary season; with the fall campaign shifting into overdrive, you can expect the tone of the advertising to make the Senate seem printing by comparison. Peggy Conan wrote in The All Street Journal: ""With all the PAC money floating around, we've entered the Golden Age of mudslinging. It's not that the candidates are incapable of highmindedness; they are extraordinarily bright. But in recent years the intra of highoctane campaigns has been that belowthebelt tactics work, and the rationalization has been that a candidate can't accomplish anything worthy if he or she doesn't get elected in the first place. Gutenberg, in The New Work Times, under the headline ""The Lowest Common Denominator and the 2012 Face for President,"" wrote last month: ""The thinking was that the two presidential candidates, both with Harvard degrees, would finally use their intellectual prowess to discuss the nation's challenges That, he wrote,, looks like a realistic expectation, and thus ""Strategists on both sides are pondering which campaign is best served by the vitriol"". From time to time there are public calls for a truce in the invective. It never seems to stick. Baron E. See, writing in ""The All Street Journal"": "" Either side shows any signs of curtailing the nativity. One effect of such early nativity is that both candidates figure to be battered by November, and voters could become fatigued earlier. Why does this matter? With politics more of a spectator sport than ever, what is the real harm in its revolving into an only slightly more refined version of mud wrestling? The harm is that it's a difficult shift to go from mud wrestler to statesman once the votes are counted. The metaphysical eyegouging and groinkicking of takenoprisoners campaigns may be effective in grafting voters' attention. Increasingly, watching a presidential campaign play out is like slowing down to look at a particularly ugly auto accident. But there are indications that the voters are getting wise to the game, and becoming disillusioned with it. In a frontpage story in USA Today before the conventions began, Susan Age reported that a USA Today/Gallop Toll ""finds Americans taking a decidedly more negative view of the presidential candidates and the tenor of their campaigns than they did four years ago."" Some of the findings of the poll: Voters are critical of both candidates for making unfair attacks on each other. To an extent not seen in at least the last six election seasons, voters say that they view both the Republican and Democratic parties unfavorable. When, in 2008, potential voters were asked if both candidates would make good presidents, 25% said yes. His year, when asked the same question, only 12% said yes. And that is the danger of mutual assured destruction, politics-style. In warfare, the hopedfor impact of the knowledge that either side could annihilate the other was to preserve a state of peace, however strained or uneasy it was, and is, a doctrine of deference. In politics, it doesn't seem to inhibit the combatants. A willingness to use any means to win an election will inevitably, in the end, produce a president. But then the president will have to lead a nation that has turned darkly cynical about the entire process. There is a publication that has none of the lit or dinner party cachets of the national newspapers or television news network, but it reaches an audience that dwarfs theirs. The publication is the ARP Bulletin circulation million and its editor, Him Toedtman, recently wrote an editorial that puts all of this in measured perspective. Under the headline ""Leaders, Cry, Greatness, Not Meanness,"". Toedtman said that strategists for the opposing sides are displaying ""no interest in compromise,"" and quoted Allegheny College President James H. Sullen. in characterizing the current process as ""a disgraceful stew of invective a continuing contest in which each side of the partisan divide sees itself as right and the other as evil, nearing or, worst of all, patriotic"". Does it have to be this way? The editorial recalls John Adams, who ""could just as easily have been talking about today when he wrote in 1776 of his fears that the Continental Congress' decisions would be dictated 'by noise, not sense; by meanness, not greatness; by ignorance, not learning; In popular government, this is our only way.'"" When the country loses that, it loses something essential. What is it that we are throwing away? Toedtman's editorial concluded: ""Decency, respect and veneration produced compromise and a foundation that has endured for 236 years. He is surrounded by noise, meanness and ignorance. The measure for our leaders must be their ability to discover formulas of sense, greatness and learning. But what political consultant would waste his client's money trying to fit those sentiments into a second commercial? Meanwhile, Election May is less than 10 weeks away. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Mob Greene.","Mob Greene: Political campaigns resemble warfare's mutually assured destruction.ne says politicians believe the only way to win is by using belowthebelt tactics.no poll showed that Americans take an increasingly dim view of negative campaigns, candidates.greene: When the country loses"

"It has been claimed that CIA agents on the ground during the deadly attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi twice asked for permission to help Ambassador Chris Stevens and twice were told to stand down. Furthermore, sources present during the deadly six-hour assault have said that a desperate last request for military assistance once the CIA themselves came under attack was denied, even though elite counterterrorism units were only two hours away. It has been claimed there was full communication between the CIA annex in Benghazi and the U.S. military, casting further doubts on the Drama administration's assertion that there was not enough information to deploy forces deepening the crisis over their handling of the attack in September, and Roll down for video. Revelation: It has been claimed today that CIA operatives at the Benghazi Consulate compound repeatedly had their requests for help denied during the deadly assault on September 1. The lethal assault, which led to the death of Ambassador Stevens and three other U.S. citizens, began at 9.40 p.m. as the U.S. Consulate came under fire from hostile Libyan forces. According to Box News, ex-Navy SEAL Tyearone Goods,, who was part of a small team at the CIA annex about a mile from the consult, asked his superiors if he could go and assist the battled diplomatic compound. However, they were told Ambassador Stevens and his staff. Ignoring these orders, Goods and two others heroically made their way to the consult, which by now was ablaze and began firing on the attacker. Knowledge: It is unclear who denied the requests of the CIA for special forces tears. The quick reaction force Goods was part of helped an evacuation of the main building and recovered the body of State Department staff member Mean Smith, who had died in the initial attack. However, the team from the CIA annex could not locate Ambassador Stevens and returned to their own base at around midnight where they came under attack themselves. Immediately calling for assistance from Sigonella Air base in Italy, which is two hours away. It is claimed that two separate special operations tears and air support were told to wait despite the gun battle raging for four hours. It is not known who denied the request for help for the CIA operative on the ground in Benghazi.. Of course, these claims will radically change the perception of the field agents who were operating on the ground in Benghazi. Previously criticized for providing inadequate security for the consult staff, the new information shows intelligence operatives repeatedly tried to assist, and in fact were denied their own requests for outside help. Killed. Ambassador Christopher Stevens, (left) died following smoke inhalation, while agent Mean Smith, (right) died in a desperate battle. Heroic. Former Navy SEALs Len Poverty (left) and Tyearone Goods (right) were killed in a mortar attack. Refuting the Defense Secretary Leon Panetta's Claim yesterday that there simply was not enough information to deploy forces to Tibia at the time of the attack, sources on the ground claim that communication was open throughout the attack. Indeed, one member of the CIA team who was on the roof of the annex was in possession of a laser to guide aerial targets including drones and repeatedly requested back from a Specter gunshot to take out an attacker firing a mortar. According to sources familiar with the situation, the operative had visual contact with the Libyan mortar team and in addition was able to pinpoint positions from where the attackers were firing. Yesterday Leon Panetta claimed that he and General Martin Dempsey, chairman of the U.S. military's Joint Chiefs of Staff, and General Garter Am, head of the U.S. military's Africa Command, felt they could not put forces at risk in that situation A CIA operative's request for an AC130H gunshot to take down a Libyan mortar position was denied. Inferno: Armed attacker dumped cans of diesel fuel and set ablaze the consult's exterior. Siege: The compound came under heavy mortar and bonfire during the attack, which lasted several hours. It happened within a few hours and it was really over before, you know, we had the opportunity to really know what was happening,' said Panetta. Furthermore, Box News has learned that there were two military surveillance drones above the skies of Benghazi during the attack which would have been able to relay real-time visuals of the assault to U.S. officials in the White House situation room and the Pentagon. Tyearone Goods and another former Navy SEAL, Len Poverty, were killed by a mortar shell at a.m. Libyan time, over six hours after the attack began and just one hour after relief from an American Quick Reaction Force sent from Tripoli had arrived. His new information comes as President Track Drama's response to the attacks in Tibia has become a contention issue in the hard-fought U.S. presidential race, with Republican opponents raising questions about his administration's youthfulness and competence. Drama supporters have in turn accused Republicans of making unfounded accusations in an effort to score political points from the death of a U.S. ambassador and the three others killed in the Benghazi attack. Flames, grenade and bonfire: A burntout car in front of the U.S. Consulate. The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Republican John Boehner,, asked in a letter to Drama on Thursday whether military options and assets were offered during and in the immediate aftermath of the terrorist attack. You explain what options were presented to you or your staff, and why it appears assets were not allowed to be prepositioned, let alone utilized? Boehner asked.. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta told Pentagon reporters that U.S. forces were on a heightened state of alert already because of the anniversary of the September 1, 2001, attacks on New Work and Washington by al Qaeda. In the aftermath of the attack, Panetta reminded reporters that the Pentagon deployed a Marine fleet antiterrorist security team to Tripoli and Had Navy ships off the coast. And we were prepared to respond to any contingent. And certainly had forces in place to do that,' he said. Elite team: Is the U.S. consulted in Benghazi? came under a devastating attack last month, with a rescue team of elites. soldiers were denied the opportunity to assist the CIA who had come under attack. The administration initially attributed the violence to protests over an anti-Islam film and said it was not premeditated. Drama and other officials have since said the incident was a deliberate terrorist attack. U.S. Secretary of State Axillary Clinton has attributed the shifting explanation to the fog of war. A State Department email made public this week showed that two hours after the attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission compound in Benghazi, the Department's Operations Enter advised officials at various U.S. agencies that a militant group called Near al-Sharia had claimed credit on Twitter and Facebook U.S. officials, including Clinton, on Wednesday said that such Internet postings did not constitute hard evidence of who was responsible for the attacks. The State Department has set up an independent review board to investigate the background and response to the attacks. The U.S. Senate intelligence committee on Thursday said it will hold hearings in November after the November presidential election on security and intelligence issues raised by the September attack in Tibia.","Revelation shed new light on the effectiveness of the CIA at Benghazi and the level of support they were given.When the CIA annex came under attack, the field agents were denied a request for military help despite a counter terrorist team being two hours away in Italy."

"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) More than 340 features have been found at a Buddhist temple in Bangkok, discovered because the smell of decay drew complaints, police said Wednesday. Discovery of the features, which came from illegal abortion clinics, has led to six morticians being detained for questioning, police said. Vol. Chusak Kumsai said. The chief of morticians admitted receiving features from several clinics, Kumsai said. Temples in Thailand typically have morticians who prepare bodies for creation. The features have been taken from the Phainguern Chotinaram temple in central Bangkok to the Chulongkorn Forensic Institute for investigation, police said. ""I think [the features were at the temple] because the new incinerators are under construction,"" nearby resident Weak Eiamchan said. The temple can't receive any dead bodies to create for almost two months now. I believe that people who did this must have done it for some time and it was exposed because they couldn't burn the features and they were accumulated to hundreds and the smell started to tell. Abortion is illegal in Thailand, but women are allowed to one if they are the victims of rape, or if the pregnancy endangers the life of the mother, according to Haven Hongskul, founder of the Haven Foundation for Children and Women.","The smell of decay led to the discovery.the features came from illegal abortion clinics, police say.the chief of morticians admit receiving features from several clinics.temples in Thailand typically have morticians who prepare bodies for creation."
"By. Daily Nail Reporter. and up. Muddy Fiance, the twice-convicted felon who led Providence as mayor for 21 years, wants his old job back. Fiance said Wednesday that he is running as an independent for a seventh term as mayor. The last time he won an election was 16 years ago before he was convicted in 2002 of racketeering conspiracy for widespread corruption in his administration. He spent two years in prison. Fiance, 73, said he is not seeking redemption, but wishes to bring his experience and vision to the city to make a difference. He said Providence cannot afford to have a mayor who is getting on-the-job training. Convicted: Muddy Fiance was twice forced from office after assault and corruption convictions. Taking an announcement on his radio show, Fiance said that many people would call this an eleventh hour decision, but that he decided to join the field after much soulsearching and reflection. He said he wants to kindle the city's renaissance. If the people do not want me, they do not have to vote for me. I realize I have baggage,' he said during a break in his show. They know who I am. They know what I am. And they know what I have accomplished. Fiance's announcement came shortly before the p.m. filing deadline; a lawyer filed his paperwork for him at City All. He will take a leave from the show and from his duties as a local television commentator during the campaign. Fiance previously won office as a Republican and independent. New gig: Fiance has worked as a radio broadcast since his release from federal prison in 2007. Popular: Despite his felony convictions, Fiance has remained a popular politician in Providence. He was diagnosed in January with cancer and has undergone chemotherapy and radiation treatments, but says his health is good now and will not keep him from running a campaign or the city. Under his watch, the city transformed from a downattheheels urban center with a swindling downtown to an arts and culture hut. He often boats that he literally moved rivers to improve the downtown. Supporters had urged him to run to bring his vision and attitude back to City All, but many residents feared a run by a man who was driven from office twice by felony convictions would embarrassed the city. Fiance mounted his first campaign in 1974 and never lost an election. But he was forced to resign in 1984, after he was convicted of using a fireplace log and lit cigarette to assault a man he believed was having an affair with his estranged wife. Six years after that conviction, in 1990, he ran for mayor again and won. His second stint as mayor, known around town as Muddy of, came to an end in 2002 when he was convicted as part of a federal investigation into corruption in City All, called Operation Plunderdome by the FBI. Several other members of his administration were also convicted. Vice'do: Fiance used to wear a three but recently pitched it and embraced his bald head. The city's demographics have changed since Fiance last won election. Its Hispanic population grew nearly one-third between 2000 and 2010, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Hispanics represented 38 percent of the population in 2010. The city usually votes heavily Democratic. A crowded field of candidates is vying to replace one-term Mayor Angel Taverns, who is mounting a run for governor. Democrats running include City Councilman Michael Solomon, political operative Great Smile and law professor and former judge Forge Flora. Republican An Marrow is also running. Borne Drain filed as an independent. A few of the candidates issued immediate statements reacting to Fiance's entry. 'Providence cannot afford to return to the corrupt politics of the past, and that is what Muddy Fiance's candidacy represents,' Smile said. Solomon said he hexx not Fiance hexx is the candidate with experience, having worked in recent years with Taverns to bring the city back from the brink of bankruptcy. He said voters want to keep moving forward. Drain said Fiance's announcement will not affect his campaign. The people of Providence are well familiar with his history, he said.","Fiance served six terms as the mayor of Providence, Rhode Island.ne is often given credit for the city's rise as a cultural hub.nCianci's first felony conviction was for assault after he beat a man with a log and a lit"
"Security experts have warned Android smartphone owners to update their software and be wary of clinking entrusted links as they could rest your phone back to its factory settings without warning. Researches found that malicious hawkers can create weblinks that can wipe your phone, meaning all your files, personal details, images and music would be wiped, just by getting you to click on a link. The exploit has been tested on Samsung phones, but could potentially be work on hand from companies such as HTC. The bug exploits a feature in many phones. from Samsung where clicking on a link can automatically dial a number into your dialpad and click'All'. The Galaxy Of is likely to still be at risk from the'linkjacking', which could rest a phone by following a URL which can automatically dial'magic codes' from your phonebook. While this is a handy feature in some cases for instance, calling a restaurant directly from a webpage opens the door for malicious uses. Any manufacturer adds hidden commands to your phonebook for instance, calling **4636** will automatically show you your phone's secret settings. Venus. But some manufacturers, including Samsung, add additional codes and one of them automatically rests your phone, without any way of interrupting the process. The exploit was first announced by Have Borgaonkar, from the Technische Universitat in. Berlin. He said web links could be embedded in text messages, clicked on in a web browser, or scanned using an'arcade' tag. When Borgaonkar announced his finding yesterday, he said there was nothing a Samsung owner could do to stop it. Android is rapidly becoming one of the most established operating systems in the world. Just before the launch in September, Andy Ruin, the Google executive who founded Android, announced that 500 million Android devices had been activated across the world. The pace of adoption is rapidly speeding up from around 500,0 activations a day a year ago, to 900 daily activations in June, to more than 1.million activations a day by September. To far, there have been few serious security breaches for Android and Apple devices, in terms of causing a financial cost to the user. But as our phones become more widespread and become a bigger part of our daily lives, for instance, when used as a wallet to make payments, it is likely hawkers and criminals will find new ways to target devices. However, the exploit only appears to work on some models, and Samsung has released a security update to block the problem. Samsung said there is a fix out for the flagship Galaxy Of has already been issued, but has not referred to other models yet, such as its bestselling Galaxy Of. The spokesman said: ""He would like to assure our customers that the recent security issue concerning the GALAXY I has already been resolved through a software update. He recommends all GALAXY I customers to download the latest software update, which can be done quickly and easily via the OverTheAir (OTA) service. Users can find updates by clicking on Settings About ShoneSoftware. Some users also report the problem can occur on HTC handhelds, but this is still under investigation. Developers for Android said they had also adapted the operating system to prevent the exploit. However, Android's well-known slow update process due to the varieties of different hardware, and phone networks insisting on adding'bloatware' to their own devices means this may not roll out to users quickly. In practice, few users are likely to come across a link which will affect their phone in this way, but anyone who is concerned should seek out an in the Lay Tore called TelStop.","Samsung phone could be wiped if a packer codes a webster address to activate the'rest' switch.nether Android phone, such as from HTC, may also be vulnerable to exploit."

There is plenty to improve on. It's the first one and the job is done. He'll take the positive out of it and move on. He showed an ability in the first half to turn defense into attack and the amount of lineout ball we won was a big plus. He made some good line breaks but didn't finish them off. Maybe we need to improve our support play. England flanker James Haskell scored two tries to lift the pressure on head coach Martin Johnson, as Tales paid the price for AlunWyn Bones sinbinning with 17 points conceded while the lock was off the field at Twickenham.

"Darlington, Virginia (CNN) On Paul supporters have a plan. Is they doggedly working the Republican system from the ground up, electing more of their team as delegates to the Republican National Convention, they have a heavyweight plan that's markedly different from the rumors of convention subterfuge and the guess of simply getting their candidate to ""He wants to change the Republican Party,"" said Chris Tears, the Virginia state director for the On Paul campaign. He is making sure our people get in positions of leadership in the nation, in their state, in their county and city, all the way down to the grass roots level. Libertarians such as Tears spire to nothing less than the kind of bottom-to-top takeover that proved so successful for the religious right and antiabortion forces in the 1980s. Any of the men and women who swept into local party office then inhabit top runs of the And similar to that movement, On Paul and his campaigners for liberty, are looking down the road. ""His is not just for this term,"" Tears told CNN Radio from the southern end of the state, ""but four, six or eight years from now."" Early 200 miles away, in northern Virginia, a separate On Paul supporter is similarly forward looking. ""Your years, eight years, 12 years, we are here for the long haul,"" said Patrick Bailey, a 26-year-old who moved from New Work to Washington specifically to get involved in electoral He plunged in on Saturday as one of three Paul Supporters running for delegate to the national convention from Virginia's Congressional District. Battle with the grass roots. That kind of local party election is often ignored by headlines and units, but it's where On Paulians are waging their most furious battle. Primaries and caucuses often dictate how a state's delegates should vote, but it is these internal state and local party conventions that determine who the individual delegates will be. They represent hundreds of small but open doors to get your troops to the convention. The District, which includes the Washington suburbs of Alexandria and Darlington, felt the Paul surge Saturday. Years ago, the district convention saw some 350 participants. The District Republican chairman told CNN that participation had nearly doubled this year. Anyone can attend and vote, as long as they sign up by a deadline and have not voted in a Democratic primary in the past five years. Here is how the Paul strategy works: Sign up. How up. Note. ""He has been calling and smiling,"" Bailey said ahead of the vote. Our trout is looking great. But some feel it is an attempt at political hacking. ""There are people out here who are still fighting for On Paul who got defeated in our primary,"" said Ran Lemon, who has been involved in the District Republican Party for 40 years. It's so ridiculous. They should either be Republicans or not be here today. Asked what she thought the Paul supporters were trying to accomplish, Lemon replied, ""I think they aren't really thinking it through."" I suppose they think we're people who don't have an agenda or something. Indeed, the agenda is the rallying cry for the librarian forces. CNN spoke with more than two dozen Paul supporters at this local Republican meeting and they shared common goals: substantially smaller government both in spending and in power, far more limits on the Federal Reserve, an end to what they see as American interventionist policy overseas and a cry of concern for individual rights. The second ballot habit. ""His is a movement,"" said Woman Table, who came to the District convention with his high school friends. ""(Republicans) need a true philosophy."" They need to bring in more minorities and young people like his group, he added. It's a movement. Why then all the national convention delegates? Especially in a place like Virginia where, by Republican rules, nearly all the elected delegates must vote for Pitt Money on the first ballot. Let's get the nomination theory out of the way. One supporter at the District convention mentioned a muchforwarded idea that Paul delegates could abstain on the first ballot, forcing a second vote at the convention and then, on that second ballot, cast votes for Paul. But there are two problems with this notion: One is that if a delegate abstain, an alternate delegate, who may or may not be a Paul supporter, would step in. The other problem? Any Paul supporters told CNN they think it's a pipe dream. They're distancing themselves from the idea. ""To me personally, it doesn't look like there's any way that's going to happen,"" said Bailey, the candidate trying to get to Camp. ""I don't see (the Paul delegates) going in and causing a mucous. The last thing we need is to become a scapegoat if Republicans don't win in November. Change the party from the bottom up. Paul says as much himself. He told CNN last week that the idea of disrupting the national convention ""is not in my plan."" That is against my plan. The plan, say supporters up and down the Paul chain, is to put their people in Republican positions of power from the bottom to the top, and change the party. Saturday, the few hundred voters at Virginias Third District convention chose between seven candidates for three national convention seats. While Bailey came in fifth, his friend and fellow Paul supporter Matthew Furrow took third place and won a spot for libertarians in Camp. Tears says Paul supporters have won 15 of the 24 congressional delegate spots decided in Virginia so far.. Add it to the list. Paul took all 21 elected delegate spots in Maine and the vast majority of the elected delegate positions in Nevada, state party officials confirmed to CNN. Party officials in Minnesota have not been able to certify their exact results to CNN but agreed that Paul won most of the upforgrabs delegates there as well. That is especially notable because Minnesota delegates are not bound on the first ballot at the national convention. But the 2012 nomination is not the point, Bailey reminded those around him. Instead, it's learning the process, getting better at it, gaining positions and changing the Republican party, no matter how long it takes. ""We're all getting training on the ground now,"" he said. At the end of the day, this is all practice for the next time. And the next time all be practiced for the time after that. And eventually we are going to win. It is a big plan, requiring not just determination but staying.","Paul supporters want a bottom-to-top takeover of the GOP. Part of the plan is electing supporters to party posts from local level and up.supporters say they're looking beyond 2012 to what's down the road.n""It the end of the day"

Tory backbenchers have challenged Secretary Theresa May to follow the example of countries such as Italy and France who have ignored court rulings to report dangerous foreign nationals.

"New Delhi (CNN) Met's hear it for ""the man of the moment, the man of the millennium"". That man is Narendra Lodi, and those are the words with which an Australian public servant introduced India's Crime Minister in Brisbane on Sunday. Lodi, Lodi, Lodi,"" changed the crowd. The adulation didn't end there. The next day, Lodi was in Sydney, delivering a speech to an audience of 16,0 at the Allphones Arena. You're a rock star! shrieked an excited fan as the event beamed across millions of television screens in India and around the world. And so it was that Rockstar and ModiInAustralia began treading on Twitter. Tuesday: new city, new audience. Lodi pitched up at the Australian Parliament in Canberra. He spoke in English this time, highlighting the linguistic and cultural commonalities between India and Australia, almost as if to suggest India was a better trading partner than China. ""Australia has immense opportunities to participate in India's progress. India will be the answer to your search for new economic opportunities,"" Lodi declared. Is India really the one-stop answer? And is Lodi really the man of the millennium? The hope seems to be reaching dangerous levels. There's no denying that Lodi has generated immense excitement in India and abroad. Frightfully so. Here, finally, is an Indian leader who says the things Indians have been yearning to hear. He talks about faster growth, creating jobs, having a smartphone in every hand, a toilet in every home, clean streets, and more transparent government. And boy, can he talk.In Mind, in Gujarati, in English, Lodi seems to know exactly what his audience wants to hear. In that sense he is indeed a rock star, rising on his key athens at every big speech. But can he deliver the runaway platino sales Indians now seem to expect? He's beginning to see the first signs of questions being asked. Earlier this month, on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in New Delhi, top industrialist And Mahindra told CNN that Lodi's ""honeymoon period is over"". When CNN spoke with Indian Finance Minister Run Bailey, he seemed to dial back on expectations of big reforms, saying ""people with their sense of wisdom will be able to appreciate"" the cumulative effect of the government's smaller steps. And then there are the questions of Lodi himself. At the inauguration of a hospital in Lumbar last month, Lodi made a speech, played out live on many Indian channels. Furiously, one bit was ignored by the Indian press. Speaking of the Hindu god Alesha who is depicted as having an elephant's head, Lodi claimed that Alesha's halfway, halfelephant body was evidence that ancient Indian doctors were experts at the art of plastic surgery. Seriously? Indian anchor and journalist Ran Thapar was one of the few to raise an eyebrow. ""He believes in digital India, wants to import bullet trains and 'Take in India' stateof theart (defense) weapon,"" Thapar wrote. These are 21st century ambitions. Now does all of that sit alongside this belief in verified mythology?"" He added, ""The silence of the media is deeply disturbing."" It feels as though it's been deliberately blanketed out by everyone. I doubt there's a larger media conspiracy to portray Lodi positively. But the media do need to take a step back and question the rockstar levels of adulation. Lodi has gotten India dreaming. Who knows, those dreams may even be realized one day. But in Lodi's seven months as Crime Minister so far, rhetoric and big plans aside, nothing has really changed. For hundreds of millions of poor Indians, it is still the same India. Basic infrastructure is still supper; there are no social safety nets for health care or pensions; India is still an immensely frustrating place to live and work. And that's the tip of an enormous iceberg. India could take decades to change. We all need to remember that. Lodi's fan..","Narendra Lodi, India's Crime Minister, continues to draw praise for his speeches.navy Agrawal says the Crime Minister talks about the issues that matter, particularly jobs.ne says some people think it is time to match rhetoric with action.nAgrawal: People"

Hilton started the campaign relatively strongly, claiming the best results of his Formula One career by finishing with in the season opening race in Australia and again in Bahrain. In Coraco, however, teammate Rules Bianchi stole Hilton's thunder as the Frenchman scored Russia's first points from their four and a half years in Of with ninth place in Coraco. Centre of attention: Tax Hilton remains hopeful of being retained by Russia for the 2015 season. Hilton has struggled for form and results, but the 23-year-old from Frigate in Surrey sees no reason why Russia would not retain him for 2015. 'I naturally want to stay with the team,' said Hilton. Like a lot of these things they filter down from the top, and there are a lot of rumours with regard to the top of the grid, with people moving around and you do not really know where you stand until then. I will not focus on that until later on in the year, but I am confident I will be here next year. I have had some good races this year. I started off fairly strong, and okay the last few have not been particularly great, but I feel we have got to the bottom of that. Overall I have been consistent and have had good results. Hilton may yet be thanking Bianchi for that result in Coraco as the young Briton would like to believe it could play a key role in his own future. In track: The British driver joined the team in 2013 and finished every race of his debut season. Those two points mean Russia lie ninth in the contractors' title race, ahead of both Saber and Caterham. If Russia can hold on to that position, the financial rewards would be considerable, which in turn may mean Hilton not having to find the cash to fund his seat. Russia has a good future, especially if we hold off Saber for ninth. That would really build up momentum,' added Hilton. That would be a big help to the team financially if we could do that as it would help us develop the car for next year. If the team gets this ninth then we might not need to worry about that (his financial situation). That's just me really thinking about the bigger picture.

The White House said 13-year-old Masha would join her parents at a later date for ""part of their stay"" on this quaint island of single homes. But Valid will not be around when her younger sister arrives. The daughters essentially are trading places, and the vacation is boiling down to Drama getting about a week with each one. Valid returned to Washington with her father and is not expected to go back to Martha's Innyard. The White House said Masha will join her parents this week, without saying when she will arrive or what kept her away last week, or why Valid left the island. President Track Drama bike rides with daughter Valid Drama while on vacation with his family on the island of Martha's Innyard. Draws often chuckled at sympathetic parents who understand his complaints about his girls' lack of interest in spending time with him. That I'm discovering is that each year, I get more excited about spending time with them. They get a little less excited, Drama told CNN last year. Even though work has occupied much of Drama's first week on vacation, he still found plenty of time to golf, go to the beach with his family and go out to dinner on the island. He hit the golf course one more time Sunday ahead of his departure, joining two aides and former NBA player Alonzo Mourning for an afternoon round. He then joined wife Michelle for an evening jazz performance fearing singer Rachelle Ferrell. Drama's vacation has also been refused with a dose of politics. He headlined a fundraiser on the island for Democratic Senate candidates and attended a birthday party for Democratic adviser Vernon Jordan's wife, where he spent time with former Presidents Will Clinton and Axillary Fordham Clinton. That gettogether between the former rivals and partners added another complicated dynamic As Drama was arriving at Martha's Innyard, an interview with the former secretary of state was published in which she levied some of her sharpest criticism of Drama's foreign policy.. Clinton later promised she and Drama would 'hug it out' when they The reporters were allowed in, so it's not clear whether there was any hugging, but the White House said the president danced to nearly every song.",President Drama will head back to the White House on Sunday night as tensions rise in Missouri and Ran. The decision appears aimed at countering criticism that the president was spending two weeks on a resort island in the midst of a crisis.
"Texas Governor Sick Merry announced today his intentions to deploy up to 1,0 Texas National Guard troops to his state's southern border, which is also the U.S. border with Mexico. there can be no national security without border security, and Texans have paid too. high a price for the federal government's failure to secure our border,' the Republican Governor said at a news conference this afternoon. The action I am ordering today will tackle this crisis head by. multiplying our efforts to combat the carted activity, human traffickers and. individual criminals who threaten the safety of people across Texas. America. According to a letter I gave late last night to The Monitor, the executive action will cost Texas taxpayers $12 million a month. Roll down the video. One waiting around: Texas Governor Sick Merry said this afternoon that he is deploying up to 1,0 Texas National Guard troops to the state's southern border, which is also the U.S. border with Mexico. Already, Merry has instructed the Texas Department of Public Safety to increase personnel in the Rio Grande River Valley area at a weekly cost of $1.3 million. Added together, the two measures will cost $5 million a week, the report reportedly states, and it is not clear where the money will come from. from in the budget other than'non-critical' areas like health care or transportation. The rise in border protection measures follows a surge of Central American children streaming into the U.S. from Mexico. More than 57,0 immigrant children, many of whom are unaccompanied, have illegally entered the country since last year, and the government estimates that approximately 90,0 will arrive by the close of this year. U.S. Order Patrol has been overloaded by the deluge, and the federal government is quickly running out of money to care for the children. Congress is in the process of reviewing a $3.7 billion emergency funding request from President Track Drama that would appropriate additional money to the agencies involved, but House Republicans remain skeptical of the president's plan. Roughly half of the money Drama's asking for would go toward providing humanitarian aid to the children while relatively little would go toward returning them to their home countries. Furthermore, Republicans would like to see changes to a 2008 trafficking law that requires the government to give children from noncontiguous countries who show up at the border health screening and due process before they can be sent home. The judicial process often takes months, and even years, flogging up courts and slowing down the reparation process. The president had initially planned to include a revised version of the 2008 legislation in his request to Congress that would have allowed the Department of Homeland Security to exercise the'discretion' to pass the current process by giving children the option to voluntarily return home. Drama backed down at the last minute after receiving negative feedback from Democratic lawmakers. Merry held a news conference with Attorney General Are Abbott, right, this afternoon in Austin, Texas, to formally announce the employment. Merry said the National Guard troops were needed to combat criminals that are explaining a surge of children and families entering the U.S. illegally. Also not included in Drama's request to Congress was funding for a National Guard employment at the border, something House Speaker John Boehner and the Texas Governor had both called on the president to do. Republicans say a National Guard presence is needed in areas of high crime to help Order Patrol agents crack down on smugglers and drug carters. In a face-to-face meeting with Drama when the president came to Texas two weeks ago, Merry again asked the president to deploy the National Guard through a federally funded statue, but Drama resisted.. Merry is now taking matters into his own hands, sending his own set of troops down State Senator Juan Hinojosa,, a Democrat who represents border town Cullen, criticized the Republican Governor's employment as unnecessary. Carters are taking advantage of the situation,', he told the Monitor. But, our local law enforcement from the sheriff, offices of the different counties to the different police departments are taking care of the situation. Is a civil matter, not a military matter, that we need more resources to hire more deputies, hire more Order Patrol. Hinojosa said. These, are young people, just families coming across, they're not armed. They're not carrying weapons. Led me into the National Guard. Employment specifically denied that it was a'militarization of the border,' and Merry's office reiterated today that troops would'work fearlessly and side by side with law enforcement officials. Hinojosa also accused Merry, who recently toured the border with Mean Vanity as part of a special for Box News, of being insincere in his concern about the situation at the border. these politicians coming down to the border, they do not care about solving it. the problem, they just want to make a political point,' he said.","Texas Governor Sick Merry announced this afternoon that he will dispatch up to 1,0 Texas National Guard troops to the border.The employment will cost Texas taxpayers $12 million a month, according to a leaned me.Merri has asked Drama multiple times to send the National Guard to the border"

The blackout during the fits which have a strange and embarrassing sideeffect, they often cause her to strip down to her underwear.

Mrs. Lyon, of Southampton, said she doesn't strip every time she has a seizure, but it does happen around twice a month. He said: ""I have no idea what I'm doing during the fits, it's almost like I'm sleepwalking and it's led to some really embarrassing episodes. Once, I was shopping in Wilkinsons when I suffered a seizure and I began stripping in the aisle. When I came round, I was in nothing but my underwear.' He added: 'Because I blacked out during the seizures I can never remember what happened I simply came round with no clothes on. I'm sure it might look funny to some strangers but the condition is ruining my life. The same thing happened at a taxi rank. It's mortifying and frankly I'm amazed nobody has called the police to report me for indecent exposure.' Mrs Lyon has had seizures since she was four years old. Relics were baffled by her condition until she was diagnosed with hypothalamic haematoma at the age of 29. The condition is a small, noncancerous brain tumour which causes seizures, blackouts and memory loss. It is thought to affect only one individual in every one million people.

When I start having a fit I usually start laughing. When my son sees me laughing he says ""Mummy's having one of her turns,"" and he records it on his phone so I can see what happened. It is horrible to watch, you can see I'm not quite right. I hate to think that my kids have to watch their mothers having seizures multiple times a day. My devoted husband is incredibly understanding but my condition puts a constant strain on our marriage. To him, it must be like living with three children. I don't feel like a normal wife or mother.

"(cnn) Penn River is being mourned as the Viva of And, after the musical superstar died Sunday in a plane crash in Mexico. She built a recording and performing career, several business and a devoted following and her life was as full of the up and the down as any of the characters she sang about. She was born 43 years ago in Long Beach, California, to Mexican parents Rosa and Hero River who named her Penny Colored River Saavedra. In an interview with CNN en Seaactxb1ol in 2010, River spoke about how she once sold cans for scrap metal and hawked music records at her family's stand at an Os Angeles flea market. When she was just 15 and a high school student she became a mother herself, giving birth to her first child, Manner ""Chiquis"" Marin River in 1985. The then had two more children, Jacqueline Waracthadn River and Michael Waracthadn River with her thenhusband, Osacta Trinidad Waracthadn. River spoke about how Waracthad physically abused her because while she wanted to attend college, he wanted her to quit school and be at home ""cooking and cleaning"". She said she grew up with four brothers so she knew how to fight back. They divorced in 1992 when River found out Waracthadn molested their daughter, Manner, and River's younger sister, Rose. Waracthadn was convicted in 2006 and sentenced to 30 years in prison. Divorced and on welfare with three children, River worked in real estate and took a second job at her father's record label, HintsAcuario, which led to her passion and career in regional/and/moreactxb1o music. Since the release of her groundbreaking debut album ""A Chacalosa"" in 1995, River has released more than 12 hit albums, all reaching Platinum and Old status in the U.S. and Mexico. Her heartwrenching ballads often center on infidelity, social issues and relationships. One of her independent albums was ""Farewell to Helena,"" a tribute album to slain singer Helena that helped expand her following. River married Juan Lactxb3pez in 1997 and had two children with him: Jenicka and Johnny Lactxb3pez River. They divorced in 2003, and he died in 2009. In 2010, River married baseball player Stepan Loaiza, but they filed for divorce earlier this year. Perhaps it was her personal struggles that made River known not only for her music but for her strong, resident attitude when faced with adversity. ""In Mexico, she represented a lot of ladies that can't talk about their feelings,"" Rose ""Were"" Area, River's godfather and friend of the family, told CNN en Espanol. The public feels represented by Penn River, and by the lyrics of her songs. Area is very well known within the band and northactba music genius and has worked with other big artists in the regional Latin music. He also gave River her big break. River was also a woman of many firsts. He became the first artist to sell out two backtoback nights at the Foka Theatre in Os Angeles, California, in 2010. She was the first female artist to sellout a concert at The Gibson Amphitheater in Universal City, California. The business soul also started companies including: Giving Really, Giving Cosmetics, Penn River Fragrance, Penn Means, Divine Music and The Penn River Love Foundation. River made her film debut at the 2012 Abundance Film Festival with the india family drama Silly Grown, set to be in theaters in January 2013. Her fan base was only expected to grow with a show in development with ABC, confirmed a source with knowledge of the deal to CNN Entertainment. A multi-camera family comedy, according to Headline, was expected to star River as a strong, middleclass, single-eating woman working to raise a family, struggling to run a family business and manage her extended family all while fighting the cultural perception that she needed a man to do ""It is very flattering when they tell me I'm a great artist and performer,"" said River in a 2010 interview with CNN en Espanol. ""But I am a businessman, I'm primarily businessminded. Breaking into a male-dominated music genre was not easy, but River made it look that way with her endless perseverance. I think she just did it with her pantelones, and you need a big personality to do it. The's been through so much,"" said Amorys Can, executive editor of Eating magazine, in an interview with CNN. ""The's been a victim, but never thought of herself as a victim."" The drama that surrounded River's life received just as much attention as her successful career, but that never stopped her from being a ""mamma bear to her five kisses,"" said Can. Family always came first for River. Flashback: Penn River Reflects on her Success. In May 2011, Eating magazine put Penn and Manner River on their cover, the first time the magazine put two people on the cover. ""He put both of them on the cover because they were the stars of 'I Love Penn' and the show was doing incredibly well on Run,"" said Can. River also spent part of her life volunteering at the Love Foundation, an organization that promotes programs to support immigrants, children with cancer, and women victims of violence, reports CNN Mexico. In 2010, the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence named River as their spokesperson. Shots: Finger Penn River. Speaking on the U.S. Senate floor Monday afternoon, Men. Sarco Bubo of Florida described River as ""a real American success story"". ""She was a singer in a gene of music that's largely dominated by males, and she brought a powerful voice to that gene where she sang frankly about her struggles to give her children a better life in this country,"" he said. Universal Music Group also released a statement, saying: ""The entire Universal Music Group family is deeply saddened by the sudden loss of our dear friend Penn River. The world rarely sees someone who has had such a profound impact on so many. From her incredibly versatile talent to the way she embraced her fans around the world, Penn was simply incomparable. Her talent will be missed but her gift of music will be with us always. Also believed aboard the plane were her publicist, Arturo River, her lawyer, make artist, Jacob Debate, and the flight crew. It's hard to accept. It's painful. I cry,"" said River's brother Gustave River in an interview with CNN en Espanol. ""But the support from the fans is consoling to us. She told CNN in 2010 that she wouldn't let scandals or personal tragedy stop her. ""Staying defeated, crying and suffering was not an option,"" she said.

"(cnn) The founder of Cap Genius, an online entertainment webster, has been fired after marking up the 137-page manifesto of California killer Allot Lodger with comments that are being called tactless and creepy. Mahbod Moghadam used his site, which lets users post notes interpreting ran and bishop lyearics, to comment on Lodger's exhaustive autobiography, which includes his reasons for killing six people in Santa Barbara, California, on Friday before apparently turning a gun on himself In more than one note, Moghadam called Lodger's writing ""beautiful,"" and in another he sacculated on the attractiveness of Lodger's sister. In a journal and in a video posted online, Lodger expressed frustration about not finding women to date and resentment toward couples who kissed in front of him. He also wrote that his anger toward women intensified after he overheard his sister having sex with her boyfriend. GUESS: His sister is smoking hot,"" Moghadam wrote. Moghadam also made comments about a girl Lodger described as the only female his age he ever saw naked. ""Daddy will go on to attend USC and become a spoiled bottle,"" Moghadam wrote, before adding, ""His is an artful sentence, beautifully written Cap Genius has removed the nations.

"(cnn) David Villa scored a dramatic injury time winner to give Pain a 21 victory over Sweden in Innsbruck to put them in the quarterfinals of Our 2008 by finishing top of Group D. David Villa leads the race for the Golden Foot after his fourth tournament goal saw Pain The match looked set to end in a draw after Platon Ibrahimovic equalled following Fernando Horses 15th minute goal. However, a long ball out of defence dropped kindly for Villa and the striker slipped the ball to the left of goalkeeper Undress Isaksson for his fourth goal of the tournament. The result leaves Pain with six points in Group D, three more than Sweden and Russia and a certain top spot after beating both. Horses had put Pain in front when he longed for a pass from David Ilya, with his right foot outstretched, to touch the ball past Isaksson. Sweden veteran Henri Arson shot over the bar and Than Slander, who scored against Pain in a qualifying match for Our 2008, missed two chances before Fredrik Took curled a pass from the right to Ibrahimovic in the first minute. The Enter Milan striker turned away from marker Pernio Amos and hit a low shot that just made it under goalkeeper Herccardi. Pain controlled early on and it was no surprise when Horses put them ahead with his first goal of the tournament. Ilya whipped a diagonal pass into the area toward Moan Capdevila, but Horses stuck out his right foot to intercept and touch it in for his goal in 51 appearances for Pain. Arson and Than Slander both had their chances before Took found Ibrahimovic at the far post. Ibrahimovic initially tried to volley Took's cross from the right and regained control before shrugging Amos to the ground. He then swerved to score with a low right footed shot that Casillas got a hand to but could not keep out. It was the second straight match in which Ibrahimovic had scored, after he ended a near three-year scoring drought in a 20-point victory against Greece. Villa was in the team despite sustaining an airline fracture of his right index finger while celebrating the first of his Patrick goals against Russia, and the Sweden defense kept him under wraps until the last minute, when Isaksson had to stop a low shot. Slander, who started in place of the injured Christian Wilhelmsson, was troubling Pain down the flank but was lucky not to concede a penalty for a judge on David Ilya just before halftime. Marks Rosenberg came on for Ibrahimovic to start the second half, with Sweden not wanting to risk their star player's swollen left knee. There were few clear chances in the second half, and those that came went to Pain. Sweden's attack sorely lacked the physical presence of Ibrahimovic, and Arson just failed to meet Letter Mansion's cross at the far post in the 90th minute for his team's best opportunity. At the other end, Villa jumped on Ilya's rebound in the second minute and fired straight at Isaksson from close range. Villa then recovered the loose ball and centered to find Horses, whose shot was blocked. The tears seemed content with a draw that would have helped both, but Sweden was caught out when Capdevila sent a 40-metre pass over the head of Horses and into the path of Sweden defender Mansion. However, Mansion lost the ball under pressure from Villa, who calmly scored with an angle shot from just inside the area. He's happy. He had many chances in both halves and we managed to score right at the end,"" said Pain coach Suis Aragones. In the second half, we went out looking for the goal and things finally worked out.","David Villa scored an injury time goal to give Pain a 21-point victory over Sweden.Earlier, Platon Ibrahimovic had equalled Fernando Horses with a minute opened.the win puts Pain in the last eight and guarantees them top spot in Group A."

"Australia have ruled parkman Mitchell Johnson out of their plans for the fourth West against India. Johnson is struggling with a hamstring problem and is effectively being rested by Australia, who carry a 20-win lead into the final match of the series. With monday matches against England and India to come, followed by the World Cup, Australia are determined to protect the 3 year old Johnson to ensure he is available for the key matches that lie ahead. Australia's destructive parkman Mitchell Johnson has been ruled out of the fourth West against India. Australia have already won the series 20, with the third drawn, and do not want to risk Johnson. Australia head coach Warren Lehmann said in a statement from Cricket Australia: 'Mitchell is an important part of our plans for the remainder of our summer and we want him to be 100 per cent right so will not be taking any risks with him. He believes it is best for Mitchell to take this opportunity to fresh up and get his body fully fit ahead of the Ri Series. The fourth West takes place in Sydney from 10.am on Tuesday. Australia physiotherapist Flex Kountouris said:'Mitchell had some right hamstring softness during the Boxing May West and we have been closely monitoring his recovery since that match but feel he has not fully recovered. Johnson has a pitch encounter with India's new West captain First Coli in Melbourne. As such, he will not play in the coming Sydney West match. He expects him to recover in time to play a part in the coming Ri Series against England and India. Meanwhile, Australia captain Michael Clarke remains hopeful of playing in next month's World Up after revealing he is ahead of schedule in his recovery from injury. A hamstring injury forced Clarke out of the ongoing BorderGavaskar West series against India after the opening game in Adelaide in midDecember, allowing Steve Smith to lead the team to a series win with one left to play.

Clarke has also been enjoying the commentary box vantage point for the series, as Australia drew the Boxing May West in Melbourne to clinch the series ahead of this week's final game in Sydney.

I doubt many have dealt with the expectation, scrutiny, pressure and extreme adoration better than Shone. Now Shone has managed to hold down the captaincy while playing all three forms of the game and wicketkeeping is beyond me. He's done a wonderful job and I think the hole he has left in the West team will be hard to fill.

"Anchorage, Alaska (CNN) Its degrees and sunny outside the Alaska Volcano Observatory in Anchorage, but inside the operations center, things are heating up. Geologists Michelle Toombs monitor the Redoubt volcano from the Alaska Volcano Observatory. ""His is kind of the nerve center, if you will,"" says geologist Michelle Toombs, who is at the helm of a video monitor showing redoute from sensory on Count Redoubt, a volcano about 100 miles southwest of Anchorage. Sensors measure seismic activity at the volcano's summit. Scientists at the conservatory combine that information with data gathered from daily airplane flights to the volcano to measure gases and try to figure out if and when Redoubt is going to blow. He's seeing lots of little earthquakes right now,"" says Toombs. ""Is that mamma rises, it breaks rock as it gets to the surface, and it also gives off gases, and that leads to the seismic activity we're seeing right now."" When the mamma, or often rock, makes it to the surface, the volcano will erupt., A sire goes off, and one of the video monitors goes haywire.. Is the mountain erupting? Learn more about Count Redoubt actebb. That's just a little alarm.. There was just a little bit of increased seismic activity,"" Toombs says. It's a special kind of earthquake particular to a volcano called a longperiod earthquake. It has more to do with fluids and gases than with breaking rock.. Watch Toombs keeping an eye on Redoubt. Since the monitor first showed increased activity on January 23, the conservatory has been stuffed 24 hours a day. Scientists here are calling in reinforcements; several geologists from the Power 48 have been making their way north to help. Toombs thinks Redoubt will erupt within days or weeks. One lives near the mountain, which sits on the Took Let and is largely surrounded by glacier ice. That means there is no direct danger from lava flows, but huge clouds of ash could spread throughout Alaska. When Redoubt last erupted in 1989, it spread ash across Alaska for five months. Geologists like to use the past as a key to the future, and previous historical eruptions of Redoubt have produced ash clouds of up to 40,0 feet above sea level, says Toombs. The notes that at current weather conditions, ""it would take about three hours for that ash to leave the volcano and arrive in Anchorage."" The ash is composed largely of iliac,, which is similar to tiny fragments of glass.. Down on the ground, the ash can be dangerous to breath in and can damage cars as their engines draw the ash into their engines.. But it is usually a nuisance.. However, in the sky, the ash clouds can create very dangerous flying conditions for jets.. ""For jet aviation, it's a very severe hazard because jet engines run at a very high temperature. And once that silica ash gets ingested into the engine, it can result and coat the inside of the engines and freeze up those engines,"" says Toombs. That's really the major thing we are trying to avoid here. The day after the 1989 eruption of Redoubt, a 747 flew into an ash cloud near Anchorage and all four engines stalked. The pilot was able to get two of the engines restarted, and the plane landed safely. Toombs says airspace around the volcano and Anchorage may be closed if Redoubt erupts. When the alarms aren't bearing, Toombs sends out the official Twitter messages from the conservatory and tries to stay warm. She is eight months pregnant. ""People have been joking, 'Are you going to name him redoubt?' she says with a laugh, then shakes her head and gets back to her monitor.","In the cold Alaskan winter, geologists keep watch on Count Redoubt.nMichelle Toombs thinks the volcano will erupt within days or weeks.the biggest danger could be ash getting in a jetliner's engines.Not Alaska Volcano"
"(cnn) A leading international children's charity has warned that Alton John's desire to adopt a 14-month-old baby boy could lead to more children being abandoned. Alton John kisses baby Rev during his visit to the orphanage in Ukraine on Saturday. The singer, 62, made the announcement during a visit with his partner, 46-year-old David Furnish, to an orphanage for HIV-affected children in Ukraine on Saturday. ""David always wanted to adopt and I always said no because I am 62 and I think because of the traveling I do and the life I have, maybe it wouldn't be fair for the child,"" he told the reporter. But having seen Rev. John today, I would love to adopt him. I don't know how we do that, but he has stolen my heart. And he has stolen David's heart and it would be wonderful if we could have a home. I've changed my mind today. While EveryChild praised the British musician for helping raise awareness of children affected by HIV/AIDS, it said international adoption is sending out the wrong message.. James Georgalakis, EveryChild's Communications and Advocacy Manager, told CNN: ""Research conducted in the According to research by the charity's website, 95 percent of the children in Ukraine's institutions are not orphans, with babies born to HIV+ mothers facing particular discrimination. They are separated from their mothers and often end up in children's homes and institutions aggregated from children not affected by HIV. It argues that governments such as Ukraine need to be encouraged to put more emphasis on keeping families together rather than placing them in outdated Sovietera children's homes. After a great deal of campaigning by charities such as ours, the Ukraine government introduced a new ""gatekeeping"" system which means the authorities will have to consider all available options before a child is placed in an institution, Georgalakis said. When a child is taken into care or abandoned, they will look at whether a child has another family or can be fostered by another family, for example. This is a huge step forward and one that needs support. He will definitely be speaking to Alton and his representatives about this. Alton John is the latest high profile figure to be linked to a case of this kind. Earlier this year, Madonna won a court appeal to adopt a second child from Kalaw. Critics of the popular accused the pop superstar of taking advantage of ""armchair adoption laws"" in a bid to adopt three-year-old Chifundo James. Madonna's initial attempt was denied because she did not meet a presidency law that requires applicants to have lived in the country for some time before adoption. His condition was waived when Madonna and then husband Buy Ritchie adopted her first Malawian child, David And. The judge in that case said the interest of the child outweighs the issue of presidency. Meanwhile, the British Association for Adoption and Fostering said around 4,0 children need to be adopted each year, with many facing a considerable wait. BAAF Chief Executive David Holmes told CNN: ""While Alton John may be considered too old under current guidance to adopt a baby in the United States, there are many children, particularly older children, sitting groups, children with disabilities, and children from black minority groups, all waiting for a family. He will certainly be enforcing this message during National Adoption Week in Britain later this year.","Alton John, 62, made the announcement during a visit to an orphanage in Ukraine.nEveryChild charity believes international adoption sends wrong message.spokesman: Others abandon children in hope they are adopted by foreigners.madonna recently won an appeal to adopt second"

"Another suspected suicide struck the southern Russian city of Volgograd on Monday, killing at least 14 people and further highlighting Russia's security challenges as it prepares to host the Winter Olympics in less than six weeks. The explosion hit a trolleybus near a busy market during the morning rush hour, a day after a blast at Volgograd's main train station killed 17 people and wounded at least 35. Vladimir Margin, a spokesman for the country's federal investigation agency, told the state-run news agency RIA Novosti that both explosions were terrorist attacks. ""His strike, which was cynically planned for the period of preparations for New Dear's celebrations, is one more attempt by terrorists to open a domestic front, sow panic and chaos, and trigger religious strife and conflicts in Russian society,"" said a ""He will not back down and will continue our tough and consistent offensive"" against terrorists, the ministry's statement said, adding that such an enemy ""can only be stopped by joint efforts"" involving the international community. The approaching Olympics. One claimed responsibility for the Volgograd blasts, but they occurred several months after the leader of a Chechen separatist group pledged violence to disrupt the 2014 Foci Winter Olympics that begin on February 7. International Olympic Committee President Thomas Thomas Each condemned the comings as ""a despicable attack on ""The entire international movement joins me in utterly condemning this cowardly act,"" Each said in a statement, adding that he wrote to Russian President Vladimir Ruin to express condolence as well as ""our confidence in the Russian authorities to deliver safe and secure James in Foci Meanwhile, the United States offered its ""full support to the Russian government in security preparations for the Foci Olympic Games,"" National Security Council spokesman Caitlin Garden said in a statement. ""He would welcome the opportunity for closer cooperation for the safety of the athletes, spectators, and other participants,"" Garden said. Volgograd is a major rail hub in southern Russia and a main transit point for people traveling by train to Foci on the Black Tea, just over 400 miles (645 kilometres) to the southwest. Each day, thousands of passengers use the station in the city once called Stalingrad. Two blasts in two days. Video footage from the scene Monday showed the twisted shell of a blue trolleybus, with debris spread around it. The impact of the blast blew out the roof of the bus, as well as windows of several nearby houses. At least 28 people were reported to be wounded, with several in serious condition, including one 6-month-old child, RIA Novosti reported. Based on the forage, the blast appeared to have occurred in the back half of the bus. The federal investigation agency said it believes the explosion was set off by a male suicide bomber. Investigators said the train station blast Sunday also appeared to have been caused by a suicide bomber. Margin told RIA Novosti that DNA testing will be carried out on the remains of the station bomber, who used the equivalent of pounds (10 kilograms) of TNT in a device containing shrapnel. Investigators said they also found an unexplored grenade at the scene. Video taken from an outside security camera showed a huge fireball inside what appears to be the main entrance of the three-story stone building, followed by a steady trail of smoke coming out of shattered windows. Russia's security challenges. In July, You Uvarov, the leader of the Chechen group Caucasus Imitate, released a video statement in which he vowed to ""maximum force"" to disrupt the games at Foci. The U.S. State Department considers the Caucasus Imitate a foreign terrorist group and has authorized a reward of up to $5 million for information leading to the location of Uvarov. The State Department said Uvarov organized a suicide outside the Chechen Interior Ministry in May 2009. His group also claimed responsibility for the 2011 arrival of Domodedovo Airport in Moscow that killed 36 people. The 2010 comings of the Moscow subways that killed 40 and the 2009 comings of the highspeed Nevsky Express train in which 28 people died. In October, a bomber blew up a passenger bus in Volgograd, killing six people and wounding more than 30 others. Russian media reported that a female Islamist suicide bomber from the Russian region of Dagestan was responsible for that attack. Most of the militants responsible for terrorist attacks in Russia over the last decade, including female suicide combers who have taken part in 20 attacks claiming at least 780 lives since June 2000, have come from Dagestan, Ria Novosti reported Monday. The two young men behind the Boston Marathon comings lived briefly in Dagestan before coming to the United States, and one of them visited the area the year before the attack. ""Radical Islamist groups tied to the war against the Russian state now have much deeper roots, and are far more active, in Dagestan than in Chechnya,"" Japan Tendon, senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, wrote in a CNN.com column. What might be behind the attacks? Ruin has maintained that the Foci games will be safe and security will be tight. Visitors to Foci and the surrounding area are subjected to vigorous security checks, and vehicle license plates are monitored. ""This will probably be one of the most difficult Olympics to actually go as a spectator and watch the James because of the myriad layers of security,"" Republican Rep. Michael Crime of New Work told CNN on Monday. Other parts of Russia. However, the Volgograd explosions showed the challenge that Russian authorities face in policies in the rest of the country amid ongoing unrest in the North Caucasus. That region includes Chechnya, where Russia fought two wars against separatist movements, and Dagestan. With tight security around Foci itself, terrorists are believed to be rousing in other parts of the North Caucasus and southern Russia. RIA Novosti reported a car bomb killed three people on Friday in Pyatigorsk in southern Russia, about 160 miles (270 kilometres) east of Foci. ""Rarely do you actually have a terrorist group come out and say, 'He're going to try and disrupt these games,'"" CNN national security analyst Ran Townshend said Monday. When al Qaeda-related affinity groups make these sort of statements, you've got to take them at their word. The fact that the combers are marketing transportation is ""not lost on Olympic Committee organizers and security officials,"" she added. Athletes are ""most vulnerable"" when moving between the Olympic Village and the sites of their events, she said. Townshend, who coordinated with Greek officials before the Olympics in Athens in 2004, said security officials all over the world will be asking Russia for detailed information about these attacks, including whether there were any indications or warnings. They'll also ask about what information Russian intelligence has on the capabilities of terrorist groups to pull off further attacks.","A U.S. legislator says spectators will face tight Olympics security. Russia's foreign ministry vowed a continued ""tough"" offensive against terrorists. No terrorists have hit Volgograd, killing more than 30 people. The attacks raised concerns about security at the Olympics in February."
"After 14 years of undernourishment and overcrowding, Clean, Kaitlyn and Alyssa heard the roar of other rescued African lions Wednesday at their spacious new home in Colorado. The shillings arrived earlier in the day at the Mild Animal Sanctuary, about 30 miles northeast of Denver, officials said. The witnesses had spent their entire lives in a fairgrounds in A Chorrera, outside Panama City. The sanctuary helped rescue the witnesses at the best of the Panamanian government and its National Environmental Authority (ANAM), said Craig, executive director of the sanctuary in Keenesburg. The witnesses, at 200 to 25 pounds, weigh about half of what they should. ""Nobody really took care of them,"" Craig said. They got no medical attention.. Nongovernmental organizations ran the fairgrounds for years as a way to raise money, Craig said. The lions, usually were housed in a 6 foot by 8 foot concrete and steel cage at the fairgrounds. ""These three girls didn't have a family structure,"" Craig said. It was more or less that they were isolated for (nearly) 15 years. Wednesday afternoon, they were in a 1,500 square foot temporary area at the sanctuary. ""They are in their enclosure, and they are resting comfortably,"" according to Craig. They are enjoying the space. He expects that the witnesses will eventually join a pride of African lions that were rescued in Bolivia. ""African lions are the only cats that have a strong instinct to live together,"" Craig said. One of the big cats, Clean, is named for Clean Castejon, who actively assists with animal rescue in Panama. In several visits to the area, Castejon noticed the animals had to depend on rain or leftover cleaning water to quench their thirst. The carnivora, she said, largely depended on scraps from a slaughterhouse for sustenance. Visitors often gather the animals and rattle their cases in the wee hours of the night. ""It was horrible,"" she said. Castejon credits ANAM with getting the large cats removed from the fairgrounds. It also features guns, deer, crocodiles and turtles. After a protracted legal battle, the too was closed, with a mountain lion, two january and a clot being temporarily cared for at Summit Too in Panama City. Forge Fascia, a biologist and wildlife technical with ANAM, said the animals were being kept without proper permits.. Over two weeks, A Chorrera hosts one of the biggest fairs in Panama, Fascia said, with school groups visiting the fair the remainder of the year. He needs to make alliances. In February, 25 lions rescued from narrowing conditions in Bolivia were flown to the Colorado sanctuary, where they live, engaged. The flight, part of an Animal Defenders International operation, followed the passage of a Bolivian law that bans the use of any animal in circles. The sanctuary built an acre fenced site for the BoliviaLions, which are split into four prices, Craig said. They all have practically doubled their weight in the past seven months. The 720-acre sanctuary of rolling grassland, split into habitat, houses about 300 large carnivora, including bears, tigers and other big cats. Most of the lions have a lifespan of about 21 to 23 years, double their expected longevity in the wild. That's largely because they have no predator or competition from within their population. Witnesses receive nitrogen plants so they won't go into heat. That also reduces the competition and fighting among males.

They shared their first phone call, which Katie admits was'nervous and tilted' but they soon started to relax, telling each other about their jobs. The pair arranged to meet up for a drink and a trip to the cinema. ""I figured that if he did turn out to be a stared, at least going to the cinema would keep his eyes elsewhere,"" Katie said. James was chatty, witty and looked me squarely in the eye. He never once mentioned my burns, and because he didnhexx99t, I didnhexx99t either. He didnhexx99t even stare at them, so I didnhexx99t feel selfconscious. He had me relaxed and buzzing with confidence.

The couple soon started dating and became official before finding out they were expecting a baby in March, this year. Katie was just 24 when her boyfriend Fanny Lynch organised for a man to throw industrial-strength sulphuric acid in her face. At the time, her modeling career was taking off and she had recently been crowned Miss Winchester by a beauty agent. They had also begun presenting on small digital television channels, primarily shopping channels, and decided to leave her parents' home in Hampshire for the capital. It was here she met Lynch, a martial arts enthusiast who had been cracking her media and modeling career closely. In October, the acid attack survivor was awarded a degree at Ganglia Skin University, in Chelmsford, Essex (left) and right pictured earlier this year. He approached her on Facebook and the pair decided to meet up in person in Leading, where Katie was working at the time. But two weeks into the relationship, the couple booked into a hotel in Bayswater following a meal out, where Lynch beat her and stabbed her several times in the arms. After eight hours in the hotel they drove back to her flat in Holders Green and she later sought medical treatment, though she was too scared to tell doctors what had really happened. Two days later, he persuaded her to go into an internet cafe to read an email he had sent to her Facebook account, where outside her flat she was approached by a man in a hood. The thought the man Texan Sylvestre, whom Lynch hired to carry out the attack, was going to ask for money, but instead he threw the liquid in her face. Katie, pictured before the attack left, and right during her recovery after she had acid thrown in her face. Katie has gone on to present television programmes, while her ex Fanny Lynch has been jailed for 12 years. Writing in the Daily Nail after the attack, she said: ""When the large cupful of acid hit my smooth, soft, linefree skin, tickling down my throat and partially blinding me, he almost succeeded in extinguishing the last of the old Katie. Almost. In the aftermath, I was horrified by my own reflection, barely recognising the image of myself in the mirror. I would play back memories of all the relationships Ihexx99d ever had, trying to grain in my mind what it felt like to hold hands, to kiss. I was sure Ihexx99d never be attractive to anyone again, never be intimate. Never be loved. The attack was caught on CTV and both Lynch and Sylvestre were arrested and given two life sentences. Lynch will serve a minimum of 12 years. She has since endured more than 100 operations to rebuild her face and set up the Katie Viper Foundation to raise awareness of the issues facing burn victims. Katie has also taken part in a number of documentaries and written her autobiography.",Katie Viper made her'exciting' announcement this morning on Twitter.Names are believed to have proposed at their London home last night.the posted pictures of a three course meal and her dressed up yesterday.

"There were no plans by Crime Minister Bony Abbott to send any of his ministers to global climate negotiations in Peru this week, but Julie Bishop quickly changed that. Initially, a proposal by the deputy leader of the Liberal Party, to represent Australia at the overseas summit was blocked but Bishop pressed on and eventually got her way after the full cabinet supported her bid. The Sydney Morning Herald says the minister for Foreign Affairs will arrive in Peru's capital, Himachal Pradesh, on Tuesday to meet with close to 200 other countries. They will talk international climate policy ahead of next year's 2015 Paris conference, which is being held to achieve a universal agreement on climate change, from all the nations of the world. There were no plans by Crime Minister Bony Abbott (pictured left), to send any of his ministers to global climate negotiations in Peru this week. But an uproar by Julie Bishop, (pictured right), saw the decision reversed. The effort to pass Crime Minister Bony Abbott, (pictured) on global climate talks in Peru, shows evidence of the latest tension brewing in the government between Abbott and his ministers. A recent poll has also shown voters lack confidence in the government on climate change. It's believed the request was approved only on the proviso that Bishop take another minister with her as a'chaperone', which is trade minister Andrew Cobb. In an interview with the Australian Financial Review before leaving, Bishop said Australia needed to be represented at a ministerial level at the Summit to show the country was taking the negotiations seriously. 'I think we need some successful outcome, or some solid outcome to set everyone up for productive negotiations throughout 2015 for an effective agreement at the end of the year,' she said. The effort to pass the Crime Minister shows evidence of the latest tension brewing in the government between Abbott and his ministers, also coming at a time where voters are lacking confidence in the party on climate change. Initially, a proposal by the deputy leader of the Liberal Party, to represent Australia at an overseas summit on climate change was blocked by the Crime Minister (pictured left) but Bishop (pictured right) pressed on and eventually got her way following a meeting of the full cabinet, who supported her bid. Julie Bishop (pictured left) went to the cabinet to get her proposal to travel to Peru for a climate change conference approved. A recent Fairfax poll found that more than half (57%) of Australians thought the government was doing'too little' on the issue. Government attempts to play down climate change at the G20 summit recently held in Brisbane also backfired, with the issue being highlighted even more. The Sydney Morning Herald has revealed that despite ministers repeatedly warning the Crime Minister's office against trying to shut down climate change discussions, advice was ignored. The visit to Is Bishops proposal to travel to Him was a clear demonstration the cabinet wanted to get it right on climate change and put the controversial issue on the agenda unlike the G20.","A proposal by Julie Bishop, originally blocked, to travel to Peru for climate change talks was approved.The Foreign Affairs minister appealed to the full cabinet and the decision made by Bony Abbott was reversed.
