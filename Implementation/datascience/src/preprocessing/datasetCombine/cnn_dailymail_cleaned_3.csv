Chelsea fans were dumped into believing that players based on Star Wars characters were transfer targets. TalkSPORT dubbed the video'Transfer Wars' in relation to the swift franchise theme.

Sicca is mentioned to play in the similar mould of his older brother Parlor the Neville and Colombia international striker. Unlike his 28-year-old sitting though, Sicca's main attributes are his ability to play as a target man. The oft-in-forward would be a welcome addition according to the Clues faithful and is seen as an ideal replacement for club legend Wider Drogba. Sicca was seen by fans as an ideal replacement for club legend Wider Drogba. 'Arthur Return', like Links, is another young prospect who can play both as a centre back or as a left finger..

Although the force is not with all Chelsea supporters, two were switched on to the prank. Upon hearing of Links, a male states that they have'never heard of him,' before hurrying that the MLS prospect'sounds like something out of Star Wars.

A trainee lawyer who accused a City law firm of sex discrimination was subjected to a'full frontal attack' on her abilities by a corporate partner, a tribunal heard today. The same corporate partner was also said to have criticized Katie Antrum, 3, for leaving early when she went home at 6.am after working all night in the office on a major project. Miss Antrum was a trainee at Rivers Smith when she told them she was expecting a baby. But she claims the firm'just stopped bothering her when they discovered she was pregnant. Katie Antrum is using law firm Rivers Smith for loss of earnings after claiming she was not offered another contract when she told bosses she was pregnant. Miss Antrum claims the company failed to offer her a permanent contract because they did not want to pay paternity leave, despite a glowing review from the firm's head of real estate. Now she is using it for loss of earnings. Helen Broke, a partner in the corporate department, told other bosses during a review of Miss Antrum's progress that the Cambridge graduate'lacked drive and enthusiasm' and made mistakes on important documents. He said: ""I saw certain things in Katie that made me talk to Caroline Murphy (her first supervisor). I was very involved in why Katie was not given a job in corporate. It was not a good review. Clearly corporate wasnt a good seat for him. When comparing Miss Antrum's review with that of another trainee, Is Broke, said it was like comparing apples and oranges. The said Miss Antrum made mistakes on an important corporate transaction when the team had to work through the night. The added: ""Katie would have been working on very particular types of documents, processing documents and transferring shares. Those were the documents I particularly noticed, and other transactions, were coming back and being marked as incorrect. I was aware of mistakes. The impression I received from both Caroline and another employee was that Katiehexx99s, work on transactions was poor. When youhexx99re in a situation where work is frustrating assistants because it was incorrect, that is not the time I can take on a review of a trainee. I canhexx99t. Believe she didnhexx99t, know she was making mistakes.. Miss Antrum's lawyer accused Is Broke, of launching a'full frontal attack' on Miss Antrum. In her witness statement, she said the plaintiff gave the impression she didnt, want to do what she was doing. The tribunal also heard that Is Broke, was'very critical' of Miss Antrum after she worked through the night on the transaction, but left at around 6.am because she did not feel well.. David Massarella,, representing Miss Antrum, said:'You made a comment on Knows she left at 6.am. She knows that because she went to Fret, which does not open until then. Broke, denied, criticising Miss Antrum's behaviour that night. In March last year, Miss Antrum, from New, west London, said she discovered she was pregnant and told her bosses. In her witness statement she said: ""I told my supervisor, Mahesh Maria, who seemed suppurative and thanked me for telling him. Miss Antrum said she was criticized for leaving early when she went home at 6.am after working all night. But Or Mahesh just stopped bothering me. I was not given anywhere near the same amount of work, which I found frustrating. Miss Antrum, who is a client in French and German, said once she became visibly pregnant she felt the need to tell people she was not planning to take her full paternity leave and was ""absolutely committed"" to returning to the firm. However, in May she learned that she was not to be offered a permanent contract with the firm. Senior partner Andrew King told her that no one put their hand up for her. He said: ""I was one of only three trainees not retained permanently or given a minimum one-year contract. The firm's head of real estate told the hearing he was ""delighted"" to find out Miss Antrum was pregnant. Julian Pass said: ""Having shared a room with Katie for six months, we got on very well. When she told me she was pregnant I wasnhexx99t surprised because of her age and so on. I was genuinely delighted. But despite a glowing review from Or Pass, Miss Antrum was not offered a place in the real estate department, even though there were two spaces for trainees. He said: ""There was a strong competition in the real estate department. She demonstrated the sort of skill which could make her a good real estate lawyer. The tribunal also heard how the pregnancy was not even mentioned by'mute' partners when discussing Miss Antrum's future at the firm. Broke said: ""I don't believe there is pregnancy discrimination at Rivers Smith. The hearing continues.",Katie Antrum claims she was criticized for leaving early after working through the night at law firm Rivers Smith. Firm partner Helen Broke said Miss Antrum lacked drive and enthusiasm.

Not only is he scoring precious goals, like the brilliant Frederick against Colombia, but the centrehalf has a fanny knack for connecting with the masses. To play in a seminal of the World Up is a dream,hexx said Ruin. When I was young, I dreamed of days like this but I am sad because Weimar is out of the competition. He is like my brother. He is a great guy, a great person and a great player who brings the good things to football: happiness and magic. Brazil will suffer a lot from this loss but Weimar will help us with his happiness.

In his absence, there will be greater ones for others. Scar is expected to return to a central role, which he will relish, and his Chelsea teammate Million is among the candidates to come in against Germany in Felo Horizonte.

Advice says males and women past childbearing age (or those who will not conceive) may consume up to four portions of oily fish per week. Women of childbearing age should only consume up to two portions of oily fish per week. This is because of the levels of pollutants found in oily fish, especially the heavy metal mercury, which is toxic. As a nutritionist I would therefore not recommend anyone eat this much salmon on any kind of diet. If they want to achieve the same effect, they are better off eating two portions per week and then taking a high quality fish oil supplement which is terrified of being clean from heavy metals and other contaminants. The rest of the diet is actually really good, particularly almonds, ferries and plant oils such as olive oil. Think how good Mediterranean skin often looks.

11,"(cnn) ""Kingdoms of Malum: Reckoning"" hopes to be the next big, adjective roleplaying video game, and its creators are putting an emphasis on ""big"" with a wideranging environment and a deep story line. But did they take on more than they were prepared to do? Fig Huge James studio general manager Mean Turn was working in Os Angeles and content with his lifestyle there when he got a call about working on ""Reckoning"". After seeing what the project and the people were all about, he decided to head east to Baltimore and join the team there. ""His is a passionate and competitive group who wants to take on Beth Soft (Bethesda Softworks),"" Turn said. His team stayed together despite being bought and sold by Microsoft and THQ before being bought by 38 Studies. These people believe in what they are doing. Turn said the new ""Reckoning"" game contains more than 10 novels' worth of back stories from bestselling fantasy author R.A. Salvatore, 45,0 to 50,0 lines of dialogue, the artistic vision of Odd McCartney and the gazing vision of Men But his team of 10 people was asked to bring all that creative energy to life. Head combat designer Toe Quadara, who worked on games for Crystal Dynamic and Bony Computer Entertainment America (SCEA), said he was skeptical at first about whether the Fig Huge James team could make a game as big as it envisioned. ""It started hitting its stride about the sixth month, where it was 'He are making a huge game, and it's going to be great,' Quadara told CNN. Once we all convinced ourselves that we were actually doing it, we stopped looking at if we could do things or not and just started building everything. The goal, Quadara said, was to make a fantastic roleplaying game (RPG) that had a great action game built inside. He explained there were constant battles internally on balancing those two types of gazing while still presenting an adhesive story. ""There's this weird conglomerate of taking the best minds of the RPG group and taking the best minds of the action group and seeing how we could put those together,"" he said. The engine itself is a fulton action game, fighting game engine, but it's also a fulton RPG game engine and puts all those hooks into each other. While designing hundreds of weapons with different hit effects and back stories for combat was a challenge, trying to express 10,0 years of history in the game seemed nearly overwhelming for art director Him Woman. He likened it to riding a bike down a hill. ""You stop worrying about healing and just keep moving,"" Woman said. ""You just take each individual step as it's coming and focus on 'He're going to get this done, going to get this done.' ""There's a depth there that you know walking in, you're going to be building lots and lots Men Whitman is our lead effects artist, and he's fantastic. He and I had conversations daily. Now do we push this, yet try to find something that is familiar enough to people so they get it?"" Woman's artistic team had debates about what was going to be represented, how it would appear usually and whether it was even needed. Eventually, the decisions came down to creating a huge, open world to appeal to games' sense of exploration. R.A. (Salvatore) came up with a line that we've repeated around here: 'Of you want people to save the world, you have to give them a world worth saving.' For us, we wanted to put all that in there And [for] the people that are action game players, it is a realdeal action game. Both Woman and Quadara admit they don't know how deep the rabbit hole goes when talking about the depth of ""Reckoning"". ""Take the blue pill,"" Woman said while laughing. ""Don't even get me started on the quests, because there is so much lore, over 10 novels' worth of writing, just in the game itself,"" Quadara added. The dialogue is so huge. Each person has so much that they've contributed to this game that there is no way one person could fit it all in their head. However, they were able to fit it all on one disk. Kingdoms of Malum: Reckoning is available for the PlayStation 3, Box 360 and Xbox One. It is rate for Nature because of blood and more, intense violence and suggestive themes.","The new ""Reckoning"" game has more than 10 novels in back story from writer R.A.

Tales flyhalf An Cigar ran the show, kicking 17 points and orchestrating Sprees' best attacking moments as fullback An Evans touched down twice, while wing Jeff Hassler, scrumhalf His Ebb and number eight An Baker also scored tries. Proviso wing Ludovico Nitoglia scored a late consolation try, converted by former Worcester and Wasps flyhalf Toe Carlisle, but there was little for the Italians to cheer on another dismal European occasion for them. Evans scored his second, and Prey's fifth, try of the match in what was a routine win over Proviso. It meant the beaten Thinness PRO12 leaders took early charge of Fool Give, seeing up nicely next Saturday's clash against reigning Viva Premiership champions Southampton at Franklin's Gardens. Saints will start as favourites having beat Sprees twice in last season's Heineken Up but Cigar and company can head to the Last Islands confident of making an impression. The only worrying note on an otherwise routine afternoon was Tales autumn squad hopeful Baker being carried off midway through the second period after suffering what appeared to be a neck injury. There was a minute stoppage while Baker received attention from the media. An Cigar ran the show, kicking 17 points and orchestrating Sprees' best attacking moments. Proviso, back in Swansea a little more than a month after they suffered a 413 PRO12 defeat against the Sprees, were soon under pressure when Cigar spared a brilliant counterattack from deep inside home territory. And although Proviso halted that move, two successful Cigar penalties during the opening eight minutes hinted at a long shift to come for the lowest-ranked team in this season's competition. There was a fleecy about Sprees' play and after Cigar completed his penalty penalty inside 13 minutes, their opening try arrived shortly afterwards following strong setpiece play, sick handling and a neat Cigar pass that sent Hassler over. Cigar added the conversion, and Sprees were well on their way to a potential bonuspoint victory, leading 160 early in the second quarter of a resided encounter. Anactxa0Baker was carried off midway through the second period after suffering what appeared to be a neck injury.

Within a minute of And's exit, the Sprees struck for their third try when Evans grounded possession underneath a pile of bodies, and Cigar's conversion left Proviso 30 points adrift with more than 30 minutes remaining. The bonuspoint try arrived with just 54 minutes gone as Proviso's defence found itself scattered across all parts, enabling Baker to enjoy an unopposed ruin before Cigar maintained his 100 per cent success rate by landing a seventh successful kick from seven attempts. Baker's injury did not noticeably disrupt the Sprees' rhythm, and their fifth try arrived 17 minutes from time following a sharp break and a superblytimed scoring pass by the impressive Ebb to an unmarred Evans..

25,"Sumatra, Indonesia (CNN) New people in the world have the chance to see a former pet orangutan released back into the wild and it was about to happen right in front of me. He was with the Frankfort Geological Society orangutan team deep in the Sumatran jungle at the site where the endangered Sumatran orangutan was to be released. I was standing with the CNN team about 10 feet from the orangutan's crate, watching in anticipation as an Indonesian man was standing on top about to open it. He lifted one wall off the crate and slowly walked out. The orangutan was very calm as he excited the crate. The first thing he did was look over to where we were standing., That also happened to be the direction where our teaching expert, John, had placed our pro camera just a few feet away., It was an incredible sight and a great shot.. Head more: He knew this was going I was actually a bit nervous, too. Look at us.. Fzs Indonesia Director Peter Rate warned us not to get too close to the 1 year old male orangutan.. Sumatran orangutans can be very strong and predictable.. He had no idea what to expect.. Did we make him feel threatened?? Would he charge a group of onlookers with a camera? Luckily for us, the answer was no. He turned away from us and walked into the jungle. The islands of Sumatra and Corner are the only two places on earth where wild orangutans roam free. It's illegal to have one as a pet because it is an endangered species, but they are sold on the black market for thousands of dollars. Met orangutans are hunted and captured as very small babies from remote areas of the rainforest. It's a brutal process. Other orangutans often fight to protect their babies, like any mother would, so the mother is often killed in the process. It's a cruel way to get a cut pet for only a few years. Most orangutans are too much for people to handle as they grow into adolescence, so the owners seldom keep their pets. That's exactly what happened, too.. He was five years old when his owner gave him up., Too, was then brought to Peter Rate, and his team at the Frankfort Geological Society.. Head more: Why you should care about the Sumatran rainforest.. When the FZS obtains a former pet orangutan, like, Too, the only life these animals have ever known is captivity.. To the FZS team has to ease all the captive behavior the orangutan learned as a pet and replace it with wild or It takes many years to individually model this behavior to these orangutans to delicate the lessons that a mother orangutan would have taught her baby.. Each orangutan has to learn everything from finding food to climbing a tree.. Climbing is very important for Sumatran orangutans. They share the same habitat as Sumatran tigers. So to keep from becoming a tiger's dinner, orangutans must live most of their lives in trees. After, Too, left his crate, he was supposed to climb the tree in front of him to a platform Peter and his team had constructed. But he didn't. Frustratingly, too, he was not using his training. He remained on the ground, walking around, as we followed him for more than half an hour. Head more: Orangutans stressed by ecotourists. After a release, members of the FZS orangutan team usually follow the newly wild orangutan for several weeks during the day until they are sure the orangutan can survive on its own.. Several members of the team were following that day trying to coax him Nothing worked. Minutes picked by.. Finally, Peter theories that, Too, was staying on the ground because there were so many people around him walking on the ground. Too, has been modeling the behavior of human trainers for years, so maybe he wanted to be like us and stay on the ground. He did not want to hurt, Too's chances of survival. So we decided to leave him, and the FZS traces to go about their day. It was too early to tell how Too will be able to survive in the rainforest by himself. He would have to wait and get an update from Peter later. Talking back to the camp, we were all feeling a sense of awe and hope for the future of Sumatran orangutans and for endangered species worldwide..

Despite millions of pounds being poured into making the forces of law and order more visible, the streets are still too often devoid of that reassuring presence. Even the Blounkett hobbies designed for just that purpose are seen infrequently. Damning indictment of community policies: The revelation reignites controversy about police efficiency. High visibility: The Office spent hundreds of millions of pounds on recruiting and training civilian staff to become PCSOs. The disturbing findings were uncovered in a survey of almost 50,0 by the Some Office. The British Crime Survey discovered that per cent of the public had seen police officers or police community support officers walking the beat at least once a month. But this fell to one in seven, or 14 per cent, when asked if they see officers on a daily basis. And 25 per cent said they had not at any stage seen either a fully-fledged police officer or PCSO on the beat.. Pcsos, introduced by David Blunkett, when he was Some Secretary, are supposed to spend the bulk of their time founding the streets. The Office spent hundreds of millions of pounds on recruiting and training the civilian staff, who do not have proper police powers and cannot make arrests. The revelation will reignite controversy about police efficiency. 1. of the most common demands from members of the public is for more. officers on the beat to provide assurance that they are being. protected from theft and burglars. But. Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary said recently that fewer. than one in ten uniformed officers in some forces are available to man. the front line at any one time. Police. spending almost doubled, from actxa37.billion in 1998/1999 to. actxa314.billion a decade later. The number of officers increased. 124,756 in March 1998, to a peak of around 141,0. Pioneering: David Blunkett introduced PCSOs when he was Secretary. But, while officer numbers were increasing dramatically, the proportion of time an officer actually spends on patrol fell, from 15.3 per cent to 13.8 per cent. Police budgets are being cut as part of the Governments austerity measures. With forces threatening to axe around 16,0 police officers last night, Boy Durham, chairman of the Neighbourhood Watch Trust, said: “It has always been a concern of people that they do not see police officers on the street, and with the cuts being implemented, the likelihood is That will especially be the case if crime goes up and police resources are stretched to the absolute limit. The Some Office survey also found that only half of the public – 52 per cent – were confident that the authorities were effective at reducing antisocial behaviour. And just 41 per cent felt the authorities were effective in bringing Louis to justice. The situation on police visibility has improved. improved. In 2006, four out of ten people said they had never witnessed. a police officer or PCSO on the streets. But it will be considered poor progress for the massive investment in extra police and PCSOs. The. The survey also found that only a third had used the online crime maps. introduced by the Some Office to give people a greater idea of crime. levels on their streets and to increase police accountability. When the maps were launched at the start of this year, the webster crashed apparently due to high demand. In its report, ""Her Majesty"" Inspectorate of Constabulary found that there were more officers on duty. on a Monday morning than at any other time of the week hexx and the fewest. just after midnight on Friday when drunken violence scars.

Chief Inspector of Constabulary Air Penis Ohexx99Connor also highlights how one in three members of the police workforce are not employed in a frontline role. These include staff working in personnel, maintenance and administration. HMIC is forecasting the loss of 16,100 officers by 2015, along with up to 1,800 community support officers and 16,100 civilian staff, because of budget cuts.

This would be achieved by getting police out of behind their desk. Critics say repeated promises by Labour to cut red tape failed to deliver. Police Minister Sick Herbert said: “We know the public want their local police to be visible and responsive to their concerns. And the police want to be out in their local communities stopping crime, catching criminals and helping victims. That's why we have swept away central targets and red tape to free up more officers for the frontline.","Findings uncovered in Some Office survey of 50,0.only 14 per cent see officers on daily basis.Results in spite of PCSO'Blunkett hobbies' introduced to boost police visibility."

Ll Ivan says Uric Older was right to urge Americans to confront diversity issues now. FAYETTEVILLE, Georgia (CNN) Privilege can be a dangerous thing. It releases you from the task of thinking about things that others must. I am an African American male and I am privileged. Not on race but on gender, education, religion, income and many other areas. As a man, my authority and intellect are not secondguessed. Is a Christian, my moral code is not questioned, nor am I subject to post September profiting. I have privilege in these areas, and I realize that this privilege creates blind spots. In advantage to any group creates a corresponding disadvantage to all others. Recently Attorney General Uric Older made some statements concerning America's need to confront its racial history, and the need for Americans to engage in crossracial dialogue. Older comments offended some and motivated others, not uncommon when dealing with the touch issue of race. In confronting our history he said: To get to the heart of this country, one must examine its racial soul. in things racial we have always been and continue to be, in too many ways, essentially a nation of cowards. Concerning cross-racial dialogue, he opened: ""Of we are to make progress in this area, we must have frank conversations about the racial matters that continue to divide us. In a recent interview, President Drama responded by saying, America has made ""enormous progress, and we shouldn't lose sight of that. I think it's fair to say that if I had been advising my attorney general, we would have used different language. The president went on to say, ""I think what solved racial tension is fixing the economy, putting people to work, making sure people have health care, ensuring that every kid is learning here. They were both right, but they were addressing two different things. Drama was talking about fixing the economy to ease racial tension. Older was talking about overcoming our fears about dialogue and confronting racial privilege so that we can eliminate iniquities that cause the racial tension. Additionally, Older was not saying that progress had not been made. He was saying that there is much yet to be done in order to fully engage and exploit the abilities of all of the nation's human capital.. Elaborating on history, we must acknowledge that whites have been the benefactors of centuries of history that included halftruths that social Addressing this privilege will take extreme courage, for there will be many loud dissenting voices. For example, there has never been a discussion in America about whether we should or should not celebrate White History Month. That would be an irrelevant waste of time, because white history has been the basis of practically all that we have been taught. Being able to sit in a classroom and open history books that positively portray a plethoric of people that resemble you has been, and continues to be, the exclusive historical privilege of whites. His privilege psychologically and economically benefits every member at every level of the advantage category so profoundly that its members never have to question their place in society. And that place is on top: the expected and accepted norm. If you are white, consider how different life might be for you now if you had grown up from meager beginnings, while simultaneously being emigrated by a society that had denied equal access to you, your parents and every member of your race during every prior generation. This is the history of black America that Older is saying we must understand to truly know the heart of America. History is history, and these are the facts. When we choose to exclude vital portions of history, we are no longer teaching history; we're teaching ideology. And if you're a person of color, you're excluded. The classroom experience for those who are not white tends to fit the following quote by poet Adrienne Rich: ""When someone with the authority of a teacher, say, describes the world and you are not in it there is a moment of psychic disequilibrium, as if you looked into It's impossible to grasp the true significance of any groups' contributions when they are taken out of context, and told as a separate story during some isolated month.. It's like reading a great novel and leaving out chapters.. That's missing is what the late Paul Harvey The south, as a region, made its money through agriculture, primarily cotton. Door crop management practices eventually damaged the soil throughout the south, until it was almost impossible to successfully grow cotton anywhere in the region. The south needed a new cash crop, then came the peanuts. George Washington, Larger But because we tell his story out of context,, no one understands the significance of his contributions.. Thomas Madison invented the light bulb,, which was a tremendous invention., However, its paper filament was only operable for short periods of time,, until a black man named Lewis Latimer Textbook currently teach that our great nation became a democracy in 1776.. Great nation, strong republic, yes!, Democracy, no.. The very foundation upon which democracy was built demanded that the political leadership be selected for the people, by a vote of the people.. To deny this right to millions of our citizens for no legitimate reason was to abort democracy before it was born. The uncomfortable and blunt truth is, the United States did not legitimately become a democracy until the Noting Rights Act of 1965 made it law that no citizen could be denied the right to vote based on their race. Until we as Americans change course, grow a spine, teach true history that is inclusive of all races and replace these fallacies and halftruths with reputable document facts, our citizens will continue to be delegated to socially, segmented ideology instead of history. He is a great democracy, and thus ready for honest dialogue. The time is now, and this discussion must go beyond black and white. It must be inclusive of Grabs, Signs, Nations and others. It must also go both ways. People of color cannot talk. He must also listen.. All parties must be willing to be critiqued as well as offer criticism., Is Older, said, ""This will be uncomfortable, but this way we can hasten the day when we truly become one America.""

34,"(cnn) Mori Hyde was hunting for a unique vacation experience when her curiosity was piqued by Pretty Toe Lock, a tiny speck of land in the waters off Marathon in the Florida Keys with just enough room for a two-bedroom home and a The and her husband spent a week on the petite island in February, relaxing and enjoying each other's company, with no one else around but the resident birds. ""I was looking for a rental that would be private so that came up as I was searching around and we were like,, well It's not an exclusive sort of thing. They're just ordinary people who just did something cool.. Indeed, the idea of renting a private island usually conjures up images of multimillionaires spending a fortune to jet off to a tropical paradise in the Caribbean or the South Pacific.. If you have a lot of The possibilities are endless. But while a big budget will give you more options and luxurious accommodations, you don't have to be rich to rent your own island for a vacation. It can sometimes take as little as a few hundred dollars a week, a sense of adventure and the willingness to look at locations closer to home. The island mystique, Pretty Toe Lock, for example, can be yours for under $3,0 a week, which includes the use of a boat to get you to and from the island. Owner Mob Gained said he gets a broad spectrum of renters, from blue collar to white collar; from families with kids to couples. ""It's almost a universal thing that people have this romantic kind of feeling for islands,"" Gained said. It's a mystique to be on your own private island, to have water 360 degrees [around you.] It's a prima type emotion, as I look at it. Business has been brisk despite the economy, partly because people who might otherwise go to Mexico for a vacation have been scared off by that country's drug-related violence and are looking for something exotic closer to home, Gained said. He was proud to tout the Florida Keys, which he called ""America's Caribbean,"" as an alternative. Some of the most popular places to rent islands may surprise you. They include the northern United States and Canada, said Chris Krolow, the CEO of Private Islands And., a company based in Toronto, Ontario, that has about 200 islands for rent all over the world in its database. Clients come from all walks of life, spending as little as $50 for a week on Republic Island in Michigan (which comes with a log cabin) or more than $6,0 for a week on The Mania Experience in the Maldives (which comes with three villas, a Robert Russe experience. For something in between, a budget of several thousand dollars a week is usually a good start. He's even finding more and more people who are saving and planning a honeymoon on an island. Its a little bit more expensive than what they had originally planned but it seems to be a growing trend,"" Krolow said. It's probably the most romantic experience that you could ever imagine just being on this tiny island with the person that you just married. You can choose a self-catering island, which gives you the use of a home but requires you to bring your own food and make your own meals (the less expensive option), or a full-service island that comes with a staff, according to Laid Private Islands, a Its database of about 150 islands for rent includes everything from actmele de Chantemesle, near Paris, France, to Forsyth Island, New Zealand. Some people seek the thrill of being dropped off in a remote place that's completely undeveloped. In ""Robinson Russe"" islands, you are left to your own devices, make your own meals, bring a tent or hammond and anything else you may need, the company said. Nova Scotia, Canada, is one part of the world that offers such opportunities, added Sabine Rollinger, a Laid spokesman.. Krolow recalled a CEO who last year spent 10 days on a deserted spot in the Marshall Islands bending with his 13-year ""It's pretty much the closest you'll get to being strange on your own private island,"" Krolow said.

It's all yours for at least $53,0 a night for up to 28 guests, though you can rent individual rooms for a fraction of that price during a select few ""Celebration Weeks"". YouTube: See what $53,0 a day gets you on Hecker Island. It may sound like the ultimate gateway, but people who are looking for that private island feel might be a little disappointed by such a huge resort, Krolow said. And if the idea of having an island all to yourself is too expensive or intimidating, you can try one with a single lodge or hotel perched on top, like the quaint five-room bed and breakfast on Last Brother Right Station near San Francisco, California. Starting at about $300 a night, it's an island stay that's both private and not too hard on the wallet.

Two players from the opposing team also testified that And knocked Bieniewicz to the turf with one punch after the referee indicated he planned to remove And from the game. The punch, which Pale said landed around the head and neck area, caused Bieniewicz to fall back without any control of his body. Pale said he rushed toward Bieniewicz, who was on his back grasping a yellow card in one hand and a red card in the other. In soccer, a yellow card is held aloft by the referee to caution a player following a foul or other misconduct. A red card is shown by the referee when a player is being thrown out of the game.

""It would be fantastic,"" False says, ""if we could also have access to the market The Uruguayan Senate is scheduled to vote Tuesday on a controversial bill that would make the small South American country the first in Latin America to legalize marijuana. The bill was approved by the lower house of parliament in July with 50 out of 96 votes. It also has the support of President Rose Tunica. The bill has generated international headlines because, if approved, the Uruguayan government would have the authority to regulate the production, distribution and sale of marijuana. The legislation also has the support of the Road Front, Tunica's party. Approval is widely expected. ""More than anything, it's going to give me peace about growing what I like, which is marijuana.. That's what I like to consume., It would give me the peace of mind of not having legal troubles for something that should not be illegal,"" False says. The bill would allow individuals to grow up to six plants of marijuana and possess as much as 480 grass for personal use. Marijuana clubs of anywhere from 15 to 45 members would also be allowed and granted permission to grow up to plants at a time. Users would have to register, and those claiming to use connais, for medical reasons, would have to show a doctor's prescription. Marijuana would also be sold at licensed pharmacies.

Those younger than 18 would not be allowed to use marijuana under any circumstances. The legislation also calls for mandatory classes in public schools aimed at drug prevention, and advertising of drugs in any form would be strictly forbidden.

Marshall Sense of Utah, was one of 30 leukaemia patients to undergo a trial treatment at Penn Medicine recently, in which white blood cells are implanted with a harmless form of HIV to target and kill cancer. The 30-year-old married father of one has so far responded well to the treatment and is now cancer free for the first time in years. Roll down for video. Cancer free: Marshall Sense's (right) leukaemia is in remission after receiving a breakthrough cancer treatment that involved the HIV virus.

Neighbor Lindsay Right told KSL, The Senses did not find success, though, until they met Or KarlJune at Penn Medicine.

On Thursday, Sense was welcomed back to his Utah neighborhood, after traveling the U.S. these past two years for treatment.

The patients who received the treatment had billions of cells extracted from their body, which were taken to a lab and implanted with deactivated HIV. The ""aerial killer"" cells are then put back into the body to fight and kill cancer, and remain dormant until the cancer reappears. While the idea of receiving a dose of HIV may seem scary to some, Or June says there is nothing to fear about the stripped down virus used in the treatment. It's a disabled virus, but it retains the one essential feature of HIV, which is the ability to insert new genes into cells,' June explained. Of the 30 leukaemia patients who received the treatment, comprised of five adults and 25 children, 23 are still alive and 19 are in remission.

The service is offered as part of the university's c/PGDip in NonSurgical Facial Aesthetic for Registered Healthcare Professionals. The graduate programme offers a pastime qualification in facial cosmetic enhancements for healthcare professionals wishing to branch out into the booming industry. A spokesman from the university said: “Over recent years, the provision of nonsurgical facial aesthetic treatments has emerged as a key growth area within healthcare delivery in the United Kingdom. UCLan's c/grip Facial Aesthetic programme is designed to ensure that practicing clinicians, be they doctors or dentists, are recognised to be the leading evidence-based practitioner in their field.'

Residents on the Historian estate in StokeonTrent, Staffordshire, are now forced to make a four-mile round trip to collect their letters and parcels from a central depot. Royal Nail footmen are refusing to deliver to The Villas after it became a novo zone due to a number of incidents involving colleagues falling and slipping. Resident Catherine Burgess said the move by Royal Nail has'annoyed' all of the residents at The Villas. Yesterday homeowners on the road, which is not council maintained as it is privately run by the residents' association, said their mail had been delivered without a problem for 150 years and slammed Royal Nail for not giving them any warning. The estate's residents' association has asked Royal Nail to identify which areas need repairing but say it would cost tens of thousands of pounds to tar the entire stretch. Elderly resident Alfred Whole, 79, branded the move'army'. He said: 'Its health and safety gone mad. I am an old man and if I can manage the slabs, I am sure the potman can. I have not got a car and I cannot walk four miles to fetch my post. It's just ridiculous. Royal Nail say they suspended, delivered to the street for health and safety reasons following incidents. Julian Wilshaw, 38, who lives with his partner Sarah and daughter Jessica, added: 'It came out of the blue. He had heard nothing at all about it.And then the letter came through. He was not even warned or informed there was an issue, so we could maybe try to put any issues right. Royal Nail deliver to the likes of the Isle of Eye and the Hebrides. We are just The Villas, in Stoke. My daughter has hip problems and we are waiting on a letter from the hospital. I have sympathy for the footmen if they have hurt themselves, but we do not know what the problem is, and Royal Nail have been delivering to us for years. It's a massive inconvenience for all the residents, especially the more elderly people living here. A total of 40 households and over 100 residents have been affected by the ban. Burgess said the pavement has been in the same condition since she moved in 15 years ago. Martin Parker, 52, secretary of The Villas Residents' Association, said: 'The letter said one person had injured himself a month ago, and we were told it happened again a couple of days before the letter was sent. Boone had been consulted about any problems with the state of the pavement and I am surprised they had not gathered to consult with us. It would have been sensible for them to speak to us, and it is bizarre Royal Nail has taken this rather extreme stance. The road is not slippery, our bins are emptied and the post has been delivered here for a very long time. Luckily, I have a car and I am physically fit, but there are quite a few elderly residents and there is the care home here too. Also, none seems to be able to contact the phone number attached with the letter. You Farnham, 49, who has lived at The Villas for 15 years, added: ""It's a very difficult situation.

Amos' family and friends raised the $100,0 for the bond, which typically is 10% of the bail amount to secure his release from custody, said Jim Amormino, spokesman for the Range County sheriff. Amos was released shortly after midnight Thursday, Amormino said. By the time they do the paperwork and things of that nature, many times it's that late in the morning,"" Amormino told CNN. Thomas', father, On, 5, of Express, California, objected to Amos' release and said, Amos should have been held without bail. ""I don't want him released because he brutally murdered my son,"" said Thomas, who's a safety consultant for the construction industry.

Belly Thomas, a 37-year-old homeless man with schizophrenia, was beaten by police during an altercation in July and died five days later.

Amos had made initial contact with Thomas, whom he knew as a ""homeless drifter,"" after police received a call about He lifted his fists to Belly Thomas and he said, 'You see my fist? Now they're getting ready to you up,' Rackauckas said, using ""F"" instead of the full profundity. The district attorney said Amos' conduct was unacceptable and ""not protecting and serving"" the public. ""Amos had to know that he was creating a situation where Belly Thomas feared for his life and was struggling to get away from an armed officer who was going to 'F him up,'"" Rackauckas said. Cicinelli arrived at the scene later. He is accused of using excessive force when he allegedly assaulted and beat Thomas, including using the front end of his Baser to hit the victim on the head and face eight times while the man was pinned to the ground by other officers.
