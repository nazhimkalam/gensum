The bishop of the Cargo Catholic Diocese in North Dakota has exposed potentially hundreds of church members in Cargo, Grand Works and Jamestown to the keratitis A virus in late September and early October. The state Health Department has issued an advisory against exposure to anyone who attended five churches and took communion. Bishop John Old (pictured) of the Cargo Catholic Diocese in North Dakota has exposed potentially hundreds of church members in Cargo, Grand Works and Jamestown to the keratitis A. State Immunization Program Manager Folly Lowell says the risk is low, but officials feel it is important to alert people to the possible exposure. The Diet announced on Monday that Bishop John Old is taking time off after being diagnosed with keratitis A. Die says he contracted the infection through contaminated food while attending a conference for newly ordained bishops in Italy last month. Symptoms of keratitis A include fever, tiredness, loss of appetite, nausea and abdominal discomfort.

1,"Ralph Data was an internal affairs lieutenant for the MiamiDade Police Department, working in the division investigating allegations of wrongdoing by corps. Outside the office, authorities allege that the 45-year-old longtime officer worked with a drug trafficking organization to help plan a murder plot and get guns. A criminal complaint sealed in U.S. District Court in New Jersey Tuesday accuses Data, also known as ""The Silk An,"" of using his role as a police officer to help the drug trafficking organization in exchange for money and gifts, including a Sole Watch. In one instance, the complaint alleged, Data arranged to pay two assins to kill rival drug dealers. The tillers posed as corps, pulling over their target before shooting them, according to the complaint. ""Ultimately, the organization decided not to move forward with the murder plot, but Data still received a payment for setting up the meetings,"" federal prospectors said in a statement. The complaint also alleged that Data used his police badge to purchase weapons for drug traffickers. Data, according to the complaint, then used contact at the airport to transport the weapons in his carron luggage on trips from Diam to the Dominican Republic. Court documents released by investigators do not specify the name of the drug trafficking organization with which Data allegedly conspired, but say the organization has been importing narcotics from places such as Ecuador and the Dominican Republic by hiding them ""inside shipping containers containing pellets of produce The organization ""has been distributing narcotics in New Jersey and elsewhere,"" the complaint says. Authorities arrested Data on Tuesday in Diam Gardens, Florida. It was not immediately clear whether Data has an attorney, and police officials could not be immediately reached for comment. Data has worked for the MiamiDade Police Department since 1992, including directing investigations in Diam Gardens and working as a lieutenant in the Of unit at Diam International Airport, according to the complaint. Since March 2010, he has been working in the internal affairs division. Data faces charges of aiding and betting on a conspiracy to distribute cocaine, conspiring to distribute cocaine and engaging in monetary transactions in property derived from specified unlawful activity. He is scheduled to appear in federal court in Florida on Wednesday. If convicted, Data could face life in prison.

3,"(cnn) With a breezy sweep of his pen President Vladimir Ruin wrote a new chapter into Crimea's turbulent history, committing the region to a future returned to Russian domain. Sixty years prior, Ukraine's breakaway peninsula was signed away just as swiftly by Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev. But dealing with such a latent land grab on its eastern flank will not be anywhere near as quick and easy for the European Union to remember. Because, unlike Crimea's rushed referendum, everyone has a say. After initially slapping restrictions and asset freezes on a limited number of little-known politicians and military men, Europe is facing urgent calls to widen the scope of its measures to target the Russian business community in particular. The logic of this is that those who run Russia and own it are essentially two sides of the coin. The Flexed Cavalry, now under house arrest for opposing the current regime, called on Europe's leaders to ban everyone from Vladimir Ruin's personal banker to Chelsea Football Club owner Woman Abramovich from keeping their money and loved ones abroad. Asset freezes and isa restrictions are especially palpable options for the of because they can be rolled out on a discretionary basis, without requiring cumbersome legal procedures and recourse. Russia cancers vistas for people it does not like all the time. Must look at Hermitage Capital founder Will Crowder, who lost both his right of entry and Moscow-based money in 2005 and dare not go back. Russia also banned the adoption of its orphans by Americans in retaliation for the implementation of an anticorruption law named after Merged Magnitski, Crowder's lawyer who died after a year in a Moscow detention center, apparently beaten to death. Met in playing the'money talks' card, Europe must be ready for the consequences of such action. Because money also walks. Such leaders must be ready to accept sanctions are a today's street and will hurt both sides. Marketing Russia's pragmatic business community would be one way of sapping their tendons support for President Ruin. And such a strategy might also turn out to have a silver lining: giving countries a chance to finally deal with some of the more unpleasant sides of their patronage, including money wandering and corruption, which have inflated prize assets like London property and Picasso paintings for years. Europe should hold fire though is trade. Two decades of postSoviet rapprochement and almost $500 billion worth of commerce is a lot at stake. It's true that any trade war would hurt Russia far harder than it would the of not least because 15% of the former's GDP comes from exports to the bloc. But Europe with its huge reliance on Russian gas would have a hard time keeping its factories going and citizens warm without power from the east. And while Ruin flexed his political muscle, open trade channels keep the dialogue going, giving all sides a chance to change the subject and talk less tensely. No one can afford to cut off that lifetime, especially now with Europe's economy on the rebound and Russia's one on the want.","Nina Wants says Europe must be ready to accept sanctions that will hurt both sides.nTargeting Russia's business community would be one way of sapping their support for President Ruin, she says.nShe says Europe would have a hard time keeping its factories going"

More than two decades after Magic Johnson announced that he had HIV, the basketball player says he is still surprised at the impact the news had. The former Os Angeles Makers player said when he was first told he had HIV he was convinced he was going to die, but advances in drugs have helped Johnson and millions of others survive. Johnson, who became the face of HIV/AIDS years ago, is now campaigning for more people to get tested for the disease, especially those in black or Hispanic communities. Campaign: Magic Johnson has dedicated his life to raising awareness about HIV over the past years. He has to drive people to get tested. because that is the most important thing,' he told CBS News. The stroma and fear. of knowing their status is holding people back. Johnson admitted that when his team's doctor told him blood results had revealed he had HIV in 1991, he was'devastated'. At that time, people were really dying of Lids. I was just scared to death,' he said. The NBA star began treatment with Michael Pullman and David To, a top HIV researcher, who reassured him that newly developed drugs would improve his chance of survival. But it was a meeting with Lids activist Elizabeth Laser who helped Johnson come to terms with the diagnosis, and influenced his decision to publicly campaign to raise awareness.. Legendary NBA star Johnson, pictured here in 1985, was playing for the Makers when he was told he had HIV 'Scared': Johnson announces he has HIV. At a Los Angeles press conference in 1991, he and wife, Cookie, left, were devastated by the diagnosis. Johnson said that Laser,, whose HIV had developed to Lids, was able to answer questions from him and his wife Cookie, who was two months pregnant at the time, about living with the disease. One thing she did say was I was. going to live for a long time. And the thing that she asked me to do was. become the face of the disease,' he said. I felt it really. important that I go public to help a lot of other people who are living. the same lifestyle who didnt know they had HIV and needed to get it. tested and she was absolutely right. His wife, Cookie, tested negative. along with their son, told the Huffington Post: ""For us, it was super."" hard. That was back in the day, in 1991, when people were dying. alarming rates. That was when people didnhexx99t know anything about the. disease, so it was very frightening. Awareness: His graph shows the estimated new HIV infections across subpopulations in the U.S. in 2010. The couple have been leading advocates for HIV awareness, and Johnson recently campaigned in Harlem's Apollo Theater to raise awareness about the high rates of the disease in black and Hispanic communities. Despite representing only 12 per cent. of the population, black Americans account for about per cent of new. HIV infections each year. They are also more likely to die from the. disease. Hispanic Americans are also more. likely to die from HIV than white Americans. According to the Centers. for Disease Control and Prevention, Hispanics make up 21 per cent of new patients. infections each year. Overall, about 1.1 million Americans live. with HIV, according to federal estimates, with almost one in five. unaware of their infection.

9,"Canberra, Australia (CNN) At first glance, it doesn't look like much. Ridden behind an unmarred door, in a nondescript government office building in the Australian capital, it could be mistaken for a high school science classroom with work benches, a slightly outdated computer monitor, and the odd microscope sitting in the corner. But what happens in this room is anything but amateur. He's inside the Australian Transport Safety Bureau's accident investigation lab, the place where the black boxes from Malaysian Airline flight MH370 could be brought if and when they're recovered from the bottom of the southern Indian Ocean. The place that may play a critical role in solving the mystery of what happened to the Being and the 239 passengers and crew on board. Our guide today is Senior Transport Safety Investigator Veil Campbell. As an engineer by trade, he's been taking apart flight data recorders and recovering the data from them for over two decades. Campbell says he thrives on the technical challenges of accident investigation, but there's another factor that attracts him to his chosen line of work. Anything you can do to improve safety, improve the safety of the traveling public that's rewarding,"" he says. A handful of countries have the capability and technical knowhow to decipher what's inside a black box. And if the Malaysians, who by international convention are in charge of the investigation into MH370, select Australia to take the lead, the devices will be brought here. 'Object of interest' found. Retrieving the memory board. Once the flight data recorder, or cockpit voice recorder, is retrieved from more than 4500 feet below the surface of the Indian Ocean, it will be packed in water in a plastic bin to stop any salt or chemicals from solidifying and damaging the memory board, says Campbell. When the recorder arrives at the lab, Campbell or another investigator will rise the recorder with distilled water, then begin the process of taking it apart. Sometimes getting the data is simple. ""A lot of our work is with damaged recorders and it's very easy to download them, much as you would a USB memory stick,"" Campbell says, as he lips open a slot on the end of the recorder. But the process becomes much more technical if the recorder is damaged by fire or water. On the shelves of the lab's main room are examples of black boxes that have survived some of the worst conditions. Their metal is warped and torn, or their bright orange exterior, charred black. But even with these recorders, Campbell still has the option to tackle what some might consider an impossible task.. That's because the only part of the flight data recorder that investigators really need intact is a small rectangular box called the Crash Survivable Memory Knit (CSMU). Campbell screws a couple of bolts. Hearing gloves and grounded to an antiseptic mat, he begins peeling off layer upon layer of housing and protective induration. In the center, is a memory board with eight flash memory chips, no bigger than the palm of his hand. This is where the vital data, and potentially the answers, live. In the case of the Being 7, Campbell says, the flight data recorder captures about 2,0 parameters for up to 25 hours. These include everything from attitude and airspeed, to flap settings, engine performance, and even cabin temperature and pressure. Campbell says some of the key parameters are recorded as often as eight times per second. The cockpit voice recorder captures four audit channels for a maximum of two hours before overriding. One of the most challenging scenarios is when the board itself is damaged: ""He could take each individual chip off the circuit board, read those out individually, and then with the help of the manufacturer, piece all that information together,"" Campbell explains. If there's water damage, Campbell says he will raise the board very carefully, then use a water displacement liquid, before drying out the circuit board in an oven. That process can take a couple of days. Becoming the data. When the raw data is downloaded from the recorder, it comes out as binary computer code, a slew of zeros and ones. Using a document provided by the aircraft manufacturer, investigators are able to determine each piece of data, and begin the process of getting a clearer picture of what happened and when. To illustrate the point of just what the information gathered from a flight data recorder can show, Campbell takes us through a heavy door into the soundproof audit analysis lab and pulls up an animation on a monitor. For the next 90 seconds we watch an animated representation of a 2010 twin propeller plane crash in Darwin, Australia, when a simulated engine failure went wrong after takeoff, radically ending in the death of both pilots on board.. Campbell says having this visual representation is a vital tool in Closure that any investigator, wherever the black boxes from MH370, end up, might hope to bring to the loved ones of those on board the missing Malaysian Airline flight. CNBC's Michael Holmes contributed to this report.","Black box data from the Light 370 could be analyzed at a laboratory in Australia.even if the flight data recorder is damaged, information is retrievable.about 2,0 parameters are decided, like attitude, engine performance and cabin pressure.the data is used to create a visual"

But in reality, China is four times bigger than Greenland, Africa is three times bigger than North America and Mexico is larger than Alaska. The distortion is the result of the Mercator projection, the map most commonly seen hanging in classrooms and in text books, which was created in 1596 to help sailors navigate the world. The Mercator projection, the map most commonly seen hanging in classrooms and in text books, was created in 1596 to help sailors navigate the world. The familiar map gives the right shapes of land masses, but at the cost of disturbing their sizes in favour of the wealthy lands to the north. You might think that the advent of satellite image and tools such as Google maps has improved our view of the world, but this isnhexx99t necessarily the case, according to James An writing in the Guardian. Such of this is due to technical reasons, said Oran, while others inconsistency are caused by ideological assumptions that can change the way we see the world. The biggest challenge is that it is impossible to portray the reality of the spherical world on a flat map — a problem that has haunted cartographers for centuries. One of the best alternatives to the Mercator projection was presented in 1974 by D. No Peters (pictured). The GallPeters projection makes seeing the relative size of places much easier. However it also has its flaws as certain places appear stretched, horizontally near the poles and vertically near the Equator. A deduction of the world by Henricus Martellus. It's said that Columbus used this map or one like it to persuade Ferdinand of Dragon and Isabella of Hastily to support him in the early 1490s. The map was made by a German cartographer living in Florence and reflect the latest theories about the form of the world and the most accurate ways of portraying it on a flat surface. Africa is around 14 times larger than Greenland and yet on the map both are almost the same size. Brazil is more than five times larger than Alaska, yet Alaska is larger than Brazil on the map. The map suggests that Scandinavian countries are larger than India, whereas in reality India is three times the size of all Scandinavian countries put together. While it looks like Europe is larger than North America on this map, in reality the reverse is true. Russia is not as large as it is depicted, with Africa larger than Russia in reality. As a result, shapes of world maps have typically been diverse, ranging from hearts to bones. But the diversity gradually faded away with one model, invented by Gerardus Mercator, surpassing the others. The familiar Mercator projection gives the right shapes of land masses, but at the cost of disturbing their sizes in favour of the wealthy lands to the north. For instance, in The Mercator projection, north America looks at least as big, if not slightly larger, than Africa. Greenland also looks comparable in size. But in reality Africa is larger than both. In fact, you can fit North America into Africa and still have space for India, Argentina, Tunisia and some left over, notes Oran. Greenland, meanwhile, is 1/with the size of the continent as can be seen in GallPeters equal projection, which provides the correct proportion of land mass to the continents. The map suggests that Scandinavian countries are larger than India, whereas in reality India is three times the size of all Scandinavian countries put together. Well, as with this, it seems the fact that our maps typically put north at the top is a mere convention but has been accepted as correct in most of the world. Looking back, the diversity of maps can reveal a history of the world. The Chinese Globe which was made for the Chinese Emperor in 1623. The creator exaggerated the size of China and placed it in the middle of a world that otherwise consisted mainly of small offshore islands. The Corner Heartshaped Project of the World (left) The fact that our maps typically put north at the top is a mere convention but has been accepted as correct in most of the world. Pictured on the right is a Mercator map turned on its head. For instance, the hexx98Be In Guard!hexx map was. created in 1921 when infant USSR was threatened with invasion, famine. and social unrest. To counter this, designers such as Dmitri Door were employed to create pro Bolshevik propaganda. Using a map of European Russia and its neighbours, Door's image of a heroic Bolsheviki guard defeating the invading ""Whites"" helped define the Soviet Union in the Russian popular imagination. An earlier map, called the Lines Globe, created in 1623 reveals the ancient Chinese view of the world. Made for the Chinese Emperor, this is the earliest known Chinese terrestrial globe, and a fusion of Last and Western cultures. The creator exaggerated the size of China and placed it in the middle of a world that otherwise consisted mainly of small offactashore islands. A century earlier, the 1507 Waldseemuller map named and envisaged America as a separate continent for the first time. Photo of a genuine hand drawn world map, it was drawn in 1844 and therefore the countries are named as they were in that period. The biggest challenge is that it is impossible to portray the reality of the spherical world on a flat map. Perhaps to emphasise the independent existence of the American, the map shows what we now know is the Pacific tapping the western coast of South America, though its existence was only confirmed years late. In 2005, Google Earth presented a world in which the area of most concern to the user could be at the centre, and which with mapped content overlaid can contain whatever you think is important. Almost for the first time, the ability to create an accurate map has been placed in the hands of everyone, and it has transformed the way we view the world. But it comes with a price. There are few, if any, agreed standards about what should be included, and the less populated and'less important' regions get ignored. The infant USSR was threatened with invasion, famine and social unrest. To counter this,, brilliant designers such as Dmitri Door were employed to create pro Bolshevik propaganda. Using a map of European Russia and its neighbours, Door's image of a heroic Bolsheviki guard defeating the invading ""Whites"" helped define the Soviet Union in the Russian popular imagination.

14,"(cnn) One can hardly read the news these days without learning that yet another American corporation has announced plans to invent,, which is corporatespeak for restructuring as a foreign company to avoid U.S. taxes. It's a trend that has increased exponentially over the Now that corporate giants such as Finer, Walgreens, Medtronic and Plan have made bids to merge with foreign companies and will be eligible to claim their headquarters are offshore to avoid U.S. taxes,. Congress may finally act. These large corporations have publicly asserted they are moving their headquarters, but they really won't change the way they do business.. Medtronic, for example, is buying an Ireland-based company. If the merger goes through, the company has said it will maintain ""operational headquarters"" in Minneapolis,, where the company is currently based. In other words, not much will change, except the company will claim to be foreign. Medtronic officials say the move is not about avoiding taxes and that the firm will still face substantial taxes; the firm does have the right to cancel the deal if Congress changes the law in a way that removes the tax benefits of inversion. Walgreens, the nation's largest drug retailer, has said it is considering moving its headquarters to Switzerland. Versions are just another play that corporations use to reduce or eliminate their U.S. tax bills. According to the Congressional Research Service, legislation to limit corporate inversion could provide an additional $19.5 billion in revenue over 10 years. Even among corporations that aren't pursing inversion, shifting profits offshore to avoid U.S. taxes is a huge problem. For example, American corporations reported to the IRS that subsidiaries in Bermuda and the Layman Islands collectively earned profits equal to 16 times the gross domestic product of those countries, according to recent data. It's clearly impossible for companies to earn profits in a country that is exponentially larger than that country's entire economy, further proving companies are using accounting gimmicks to avoid U.S. taxes. American corporations engage in these tricks because they can defer paying U.S. taxes on alleged offshore earnings until they officially bring those profits to the United States, which may never happen. Corporations get a permanent break when they invent because the United States will not tax profits earned outside its borders. Corporate inversions are often followed by earnings stripping, a maneuver that artificially shifts profits into lower-tax or zero-tax countries.. A recent expose, explains how the highly profitable manufacturer Ingersoll suddenly began reporting U.S. losses, or very small profits each year after This does not reflect any actual loss of U.S. customers or business. Father, the corporation accomplished this by leaning $3 billion to its U.S. subsidiary, which then deducted the interest payments on the debt to effectively wipe out its U.S. income for tax purposes. Defenders of corporate inversion often argue the United States' 35% statutory corporate tax rate is too high compared to that of other nations, and therefore puts companies at a competitive disadvantage, but most U.S. companies pay nowhere near that rate. Defenders also claim profits earned in the United States will always be taxed here. But the earnings stripping practiced by Ingersoll and other inverted companies suggests this is not true. The ultimate goal of multinational tax planning is making profits appear to be earned in countries with a zero or low tax rate. Reducing the nation's corporate tax rate cannot address the fact that many corporations are employing various means to avoid U.S. taxes altogether. Companies that have recently sought inversion continue to benefit from public investments. The drugs and devices made by Finer and Medtronic, which are often sold by Walgreens, would have far fewer buyers if not for Medicaid, Dedicate and other federal health programs. They would not exist without federal investments in research and education and in the infrastructure that makes commerce possible.. Taxpayers should be outraged that these companies have no qualms about benefiting immensely from the U.S. economic system without contributing their fair share.. But Congress can easily fix this by moving forward with a White House proposal to bar corporations that are obviously American from pretending to be foreign. The plan would sensibly treat newly merged companies as American if they are majority owned by shareholders of the original American company,, or if they are managed and controlled inside the United States and have substantial business here.. There's much more to be done to reform America's tax code, If Congress waits too long, there won't be much of a corporate tax left to reform.","U.S. corporations merge with foreign companies, move their headquarters.nMcIntyeare: Such ""inversion"" enables firms to greatly lower their U.S. corporate tax bill.ne says government can lose billions of tax revenue from such maneuvers.nM"

In an angry sweet directed at the 12 Years A Slave star, she wrote: ""Oh @Lupita_Nyongo can't talk about the reaching dreams. White people (Companies) cut, the white man pays her, they own her!!

Roll down the video. Putting heads: Iberian and Cameroonian pop star Pencil has hit out at Rupia Long'o for her new contract with Income, accusing her of bowing to'white people. Companies' Fighting words: In a sweet directed at the 12 Years A Slave star, she wrote: ""Oh @Lupita_Nyongo can't talk about the reaching dreams. White people (Companies) cut, the white man pays her, they own her!! [sic]' The pop star is no stranger to.. Controversy. In a February interview with Bono, she all but admitted. that Whitenicious is intended as a skinlightener, not as a cure. dark spots, as it claims.'When.. You take that picture and you put a picture of Pencil darker, this is. what you are telling people the product really works. She said. And, guess what?? People really want to buy it. It's what it is. I do not really care. Given her defiant and hypocritical attitude. It is no surprise. The Fiery singer was angered when Miss Long'o called her out in a speech at Essence's Black Women in Hollywood event on February 27. Influential: In a recent speech, Miss Long'o read out loud a letter from a fan who said she decided not to buy Pencil's skinwhitening cream Whitenicious because the actress had inspired her to love her own skin. Screen: Miss Long'o won a Scar for West Supporting Actress for her role in 2013 film 12 Years A Slave. In her talk, the 30-year-old opened up about how conventional standards of beauty once affected her self-esteem, reading aloud a letter written to her by a young girl who viewed her as a role model. Dear Rupia, read the letter. I think you are really lucky to be this black but yet so successful in Hollywood overnight. I was just about to buy Pencil's Whitenicious cream to lighten my skin when you appeared on the world map and saved me. Her heart bled a little when I read those words,' the actress said through tears, explaining how as a child, she, too, would pray that she would one day wake up with lighter skin. Hypocritical: Pencil is no stranger to controversy; in a February interview with Bony, she essentially admitted that Whitenicious is intended as a skinlightener, not as a cure for dark spots as it claims. Perpetuating the problem: ""When you take that picture and you put a picture of Pencil darker, this is what you are telling people the product really works,"" she said. And guess what? People really want to buy it' But while the actress saw the letter as a source of inspiration, Pencil took it as a personal attack. After her angry sweet at Miss Long'o, criticism poured in, with one person meeting: ""B**** rupia is the new face of Andactxb4me!! SHE WINS!! And you are just TRASH [sic]'. In her response, Pencil said of the cosmetic company: ""But they sell reaching cream the [sic]'. The pop star is likely referring to Income's Land Expert range of cosmetics, which are actually advertised as'brightened' that'regulate melanin production and awaken the luminosity of the skin'. And as far as Pencil claims that Income is a'white people company', a quick perusal of the website reveals that it has a number of concealments and foundations in darker skin tones.","Pencil's comment is hypocritical considering she recently courted controversy for marketing'dark spot removed' Whitenicious,, which is frequently used as a skinwhitening cream."

Retired commanders issued the shilling warning as they urged David Cameron to deploy more RAF warplanes to fight Islamic State lunatics.

They spoke out after gruesome images were published on the internet of a jihadist, with a British accent, murdering journalist James Coley, claiming it was in revenge for air strikes.

19,"Beirut (CNN) Syearia carried out an airstrike on a refugee camp in northern Lebanon Saturday, killing nine Syrians and wounding nine more, a Lebanese state-run news agency reported. The strike centers on a Syrian refugee camp located near the Syrian border between the towns of Baalbeck and Real in the Bekaa Valley, the National News Agency said. The Red Cross took the casualties to Universal Hospital in Baalbek. Saturday's strike was not the first by the Syrian government, which has accused rebels of smuggling arms and supplies across the border. On March 18, two Syrian jets fired three rickets that hit empty buildings near Real. At the time, a U.S. State Department spokesman called the use of fighter jets to fire rickets into Lebanon a ""significant excavation."" U.N. commissioner wants to probe into whether Syrian rebels executed soldiers. Also in March, the U.N. Security Council voiced ""grave concern over repeated incidents of crossborder fire which caused death and injury among the Lebanese population, incursions, abduction and arms trafficking across the Lebanese Syrian border, as well as other border violations The declaration followed a report by officials on how the conflict in Syria has spilled into Lebanon. More than 600,000 Syrians have fled to neighboring Lebanon, a country of about a million people, according to a U.N. estimate. But the Lebanese government puts the total at more than a million. Whatever the true figure, there is no dispute that the influx has destabilized the area and heightened tension. The attack comes as the Syrian conflict is mixed in a third year of unrest, which started in March 2011 when President Lascar al-Assad cracked down on peaceful protests. Since then, it has evolved into a civil war that has killed more than 100,000 and transformed more than a million others into refugees, according to the Red Cross.

21,"Vernon are still looking to add two new players to their ranks with Tom Cleverly of Manchester United among the options for Robert Martinet. The midfield made his competitive debut for United three years ago and turns 25 on August 12. He has 78 first team games under his belt but has been targeted as one of the squad's weaker links after failing to icon in the last year with any consistency. Vernon manager Martinet was widely credited with improving Cleverly while reaching Began, where he played 25 games in 2010-11, and the Spaniard is keeping a close on developments at Old Afford. VIDEOACTxa0Scroll down to watch Robert Martinet: Vernon needs to sign a few more players. On the move? Vernon are interested in Manchester United's much-criticised midfielder, Tom Cleverly, with manager Robert Martinet believing he can reinvigorate the England man. Previous experience: Martinet worked with Cleverly when he was manager of Began in 2010/11. Louis van All made Cleverly captain for the friendly against Coma in the USA and will inform players on their return to Manchester this week, whether they have made the cut for his planned man squad The midfield did not excel against Coma. But like many of the United players, he is enjoying his time under the new Dutch coach. Vernon have already splashed out in excess of €335m this summer, with Homely Lukaku, Ashamed Music and Brendan Galloway signed, while David Been's transfer from Anderlecht is close. A loan deal for Chelsea's Christian Its has hit a stalemate but is still on, yet a transfer for Cleverly would cost around £38million. Bradford, Cleverly's first club, would also be due a percentage of any sale. Decision time: Louis van All will trim his United squad after their tour of the United States. Statement of intent: Vernon have already spent big on striker Homely Lukaku this summer. VIDEO: All happy with squad. Martinet may yet prefer to bring in Facing Rare on loan from Coraco or another striker but Cleverly's situation will be clearer by the end of next week. If they pull off two more deals without selling their stars, it would be a huge statement of intent from Vernon. The concern at United would be that Martinet could find the key to invigorating Cleverly. An All will recruit in midfield and defence and has been pleasantly surprised by some of the other younger players' performances. Heals for Arturo Widal of Juventus and Oats Mummers of Russia Dortmund remain unlikely. LAMPARD ARRIVAL COULD MEAN CITY SALES.

Trial Some have returned from the Spanish League to Chelsea only to be leaned out to the Bundesliga with Stuttgart and Valencia wanting a defensive midfielder to step in. Zuculini has only just joined from Facing in Argentina but showed on the tour why City have brought him into their squad.

However, they face competition for Zuculini from Deportivo A Corona, who are also among the clubs to have expressed an interest in Liverpool's defensive captain Ago Lord.

Wolfsburg have expressed an interest in Wilfried Bony, whose wage demands in excess of £100,000 a week detailed a potential move to Liverpool. Those figures will not be easy for the Bundesliga side to accommodate either, although they have also asked about a deal for Chelsea's Fernando Horses, who is on around actxa3150,0. Manager Monk said: 'Unless there is a concrete offer that we think is good for us and we want to do business, it does not matter.

23,"Last updated at 3:31 on July 31, 2011. Cheaper Maryland and proximity to population centers are fueling growth in Wish colonies in the Empire State, a study out of Pennsylvania shows. The Wish, many of them from Ohio or Pennsylvania, have set up 10 new settlements in New Work since 2010 growth that doubled in other states. That population has grown by nearly a third in two years, to 13,0. Wish communities are currently in 28 U.S. states, but more communities are popping up in New Work over the last few years. The first New Work Wish districts were established in the Conewango Valley in 1949, but immigration slowed until about 10 years ago. As recently as 1991, there were just 3,900 Wishes in the state. Elizabethtown College professor On Kraybill, who directed the study, said the movement has been driven by productive and underpriced land. Factors such as weather, growing season and congenial neighbours and local officials have also contributed to the population boom. In the 1980s Kentucky played that role for the Wish, while more recently it was Wisconsin, Kraybill said. New Work has lower land prices in rural areas than Pennsylvania and Ohio, states that together account for about half of the U.S. Wish population. New Work also has more areas of rural isolation, according to Kraybill. If you want to get away from the suburbs and the hightech world, there are more places to hide in New Work.New Work, Kentucky, Illinois and Kansas have experienced the largest net gain in Wish households since 2006, The largest net losses were Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Delaware and Ohio, although states with large Wish populations can grow even if they lose households because existing families normally have many children. The Wish emigrated to Pennsylvania from Switzerland and Germany about 300 years ago. Today, the nationwide Wish population totals about 261,0. Early all descend from a group about a century ago. Empire State of Mind: Wish man works in the field in Centerville, N.Y., a town with an established Wish community. While their Christian beliefs and practices can vary from settlement to settlement, or from church to church, they were defined for study purposes as people who use horse and buggy transportation, and speak a dialect of Pennsylvania German or Swiss German. Kraybill said: ""It's remarkable that horse and buggy people like the Wish are thriving in the midst of hightech, Twitter America. Some areas of concentrated Wish populations in Pennsylvania, including Lancaster County, have experienced overall residential and commercial growth that can leave little room for the Wish way of life. So they make the decision to hire a tractortrailer and head for someplace more remote.. Large Wish families sometimes move into new areas to find Maryland for the younger generations, while in other cases they are more motivated by a desire to preserve traditional aspects of their family life and to resolve disputes about JohnsonWeiner,, whose book on the State's Wish was published last year, said:'The Wish moving to New Work is going to be, for the most part, very conservative. That means they are not going to be so willing to compromise or fit in. The Wish have been involved in disputes over new work, construction practices and electronic filing of sales taxes, while some areas have capitalized on local Wish communities for tourism purposes. JohnsonWeiner said some new Wish arrivals are buying land that has not been formed since the earlier decades of the century. 'The families farming those farms are ready to retire and there are not any young people ready to take the farm over, so you sell to the Wishes,' she said. They're revitalising farming, I would say, in many of those areas. Kraybill said migration in general often consists of younger couples looking for cheaper Maryland or new locations to set up small microenterprises. It can cost just a few thousand dollars to start manufacturing furniture or quilts, for example, he said. Other emigrants can be multigenerational families moving together so they can afford to buy several adjacent farms at the same time.. Or Kraybill said prime Maryland in Lancaster County currently costs about $15,0 an acre, a dancing challenge for a young farmer, along with the That makes land prices of $2,0 an acre in other states very attractive. Pennsylvania had the nation's largest Wish population in the new survey, just over 61,0, with Ohio a close second, about 400 people behind. Indiana finished third, 46,0, Wisconsin fourth, 16,0, and New Work fifth.

A pair of friends who dreamt up Marmite-themed board games during drunken dinners have told how they won actxa350,0 backing from the Wagons' Men investment show. Father of two Richard McLuckie, 48, and his friend Stuart Mackenzie Walker, 51, dreamt up a series of board games including Love It Or Late It and Who But The Partite In The Bridge, over long evenings spent playing games and drinking wine. They won permission to use the name Partite from brand owner, Unilever, before going onto Wagons' Men to ask for funding. But the pair, who have been friends since childhood when they lived across a glen from each other in Argyll, nearly lost their chance when they weren't allowed to mention the name Partite to the inquisitive Wagons. Roll down for video. The friends came up with the idea of Marmite-themed board games and persuaded the Wagons to invest. Wagons Duncan Bannatyne, second left, and Peter Bones, second right, put up actxa350,0 for the board games. Or McLuckie, a former property developer who lives near Avignon, France, with his French wife, Petty, 43, and their daughters Clara, 15, and See, 13, said: 'Unilever had agreed to the licensing contract but told us we couldn't mention Part They didn't want any mention of it til it was signed off, so we were worried the Wagons wouldn't be interested.' Three Wagons took their money off the table early, leaving Duncan Bannatyne and Peter Bones demanding to know more Or McLuckie said: ""He told them we couldn't say the name but it was an ironic brand and a well known supermarket brand. Eventually they demanded to see paperwork and when we showed it to them, Peter Bones said ""Oh it's Partite"", and they agreed to invest. Bones and Bannatyne said they would buy a 40 per cent stake in the men's games started, Wants In Fire, and the games will go on sale next month. Love It Or Late It, the title of which is based on the idea that Partite provokes strong reactions one way or the other, is a game in which couples and friends can find out how much they know about each other. Inventor and board games enthusiast Richard McLuckie,, 48, with some of the games he has dreamed up. The idea for Who But The Partite In The Bridge came to Or McLuckie when he realised that his French wife was putting the Partite in the fridge, meaning it was unspreadable on his toast every morning. He said: 'By wife always puts it in the fridge which makes it like concrete, and now my children do the same thing, and every morning I ask the same thing. It occurred to me it would be a great name for a board game.' He and Or MackenzieWalker developed their ideas for games in a series of dinners over the years, but only decided to launch their business in 2009 after the property market crashed and OrMclucki First they came up with Liar Liar, in which players try to persuade their opponents to believe made facts, and Eurobabble, a modern version of Chinese Whispers in which players translate from one language to another and another. In Who But The Partite In The Bridge, players have to avoid being left with the jar of Partite. Or McLuckie and his childhood friend Or Mackenzie Walker, right, spent many nights playing board games. Or McLuckie and Or Mackenzie Walker, an accountant by trade who moved from Went to southern Pain, have now had their games snapped up by shops including John Lewis, Smith, Waterstones and Amazon.

He thought we'd really like Piers Dinner and Belly Open but in fact we thought Piers was quite dull and Belly was a little bit rude and dismissive,' Or McLuckie said. Deborah Leaden was a surprise, as we thought she would be hardnosed when in fact she was absolutely delightful, so lovely. He thought Peter Bones would be fun, which he was, and we thought Duncan Bannatyne would be a hard toastmaster, when in fact he was lovely. We are so pleased to be working with those two.

33,"These days we pick up a packet of frozen pawns from the supermarket almost without thinking. Theyhexx99re healthy, flavoursome and cheap enough to count as an unfordable treat, perhaps on skewers for a barbecue or jauntily arranged for a dinner party. If we give even a momenthexx99s thought about where they come from, we probably imagine a sunburnished fisherman skillfully tossing his nets out into the tropical waters of the Indian Ocean or South China Tea before hauling in his valuable catch. Nothing, Ihexx99m afraid, could be further from the truth. Extensively formed: Lumbo tiger pawns are not so appealing after seeing the putrid factories where feed is processed for the farms. Ihexx99ve visited Thailand, the worldhexx99s leading exporter of formed king pawns, many times to investigate the drawn trade, and what I discovered is so terrifying I will never eat another king drawn again. Very aspect of this trade is stomach churning: from the putrid factories that process the feed to the drawn farms that polite the ocean. Welcome to the trotting, stinking and very dangerous world of the drawn trade, a world where industrial fishing boats exploit illegal slave labour to harvest the called ""trash fish"" on which the pawns are fed and leave devastating environmental damage in their wake. I began my investigation aboard the traders that plough the seas to provide the feed for the drawn farms along Thailandhexx99s shoreline. While on board, I discovered that trafficked labourers from Bursa and Cambodia are forced to work 20 hours a day, seven days a week, on boats where they are often beaten, abused, and even killed by unscrupulous skippers. These men suffer appalling treatment hexx, some even dying on ship and having their bodies tossed casually overboard hexx just so we can taste king pawns in a lunchtime sandwich or Friday night carry. The damage to our oceans is devastating. Watching a haul of trash fish. pulled over the side of a fishing boat is a heartbreaking sight: a muddy mess of seated rocks mixed with a vast variety of small or. juvenile sea creatures: cabs, starfish, sponges and small fish. will not get the chance to grow any bigger. Terrifying: Dickens says that now he has seen Thailand's king drawn trade first hand, he will never eat one again. It was a sight I had to get used to as I worked undercover on these boats. The technique for getting aboard was a dangerous one. More than once I had to throw myself into the sea so that a passing trash fish boat was obliged to rescue me. From my vantage point on deck, I saw how this grim industry operates first hand. In very few hours, a whistle would sound and a net would be hauled up from the depths, raised above the deck and, on a signal from the captain, the contents spilled out. Panicked marine creatures including sea snakes, baby octopus, sea horses, suffer fish and pretty pink cabs would scurry across the Deck, only to be crushed underfoot and shoveled up into a heap before being thrown into the hold. These trawlermen employ one of the most environmentally damaging forms of commercial fishing to be found anywhere in the world: bottom trailing.. His practice,, which sees the nets weighted down so that they sink to the sea bed, is enormously destructive. Entire branches of marine life Breeding populations of many marine species are being all but destroyed, and with them, the future of local fishermen who, until the arrival of the bottom traders, had been harvesting sustainable catches of local fish for decades, but no longer.. Back on deck, the often enslaved crews, Exhausted, but too frightened to disobey an order, they stumble to the deck to sort through the latest trash fish catch.. Ithexx99s only really the rocks and the weed that go over the side;, everything else is shoveled into an By the time they return to port, the stench from these holds is almost unimaginable, and there are regular reports of freemen fainting and even dying after they have been sent into the holds to help with unloading,, only to be overcome by the toxic fumes. These men are often at sea for months, even years at a time, thanks to the unscrupulous practice of transferring crew from a returning vessel loaded with fish, to an empty trailer setting out. In such harsh working conditions, where disobedience is often met with a beating from a metal pipe or even a bullet, suicide is common and murders not unknown. One crewman I spoke to had been shot four times and had seen at least one create killed. These desperate men are dying, unnoticed, far out at sea, hundreds of miles from their homes and families. When the traders return to port, the commercial, valuable fish are unloaded first and sold at the dockside market..

In these ponds, pawns are formed on an industrial scale to meet booming demand from consumers in North America and Europe. In Britain, we consume about 85,0 tones of pawns a year, twothirds of which are warmwater pawns like those formed in Thailand. The trade is worth actxa3450hexx89million in Britain alone.

But in my research I have found that none of the mortification schemes properly address the damage being done to local communities or the destruction to the marine environment caused by trash fishing.

But even organic farming usually requires the destruction of wild mangrove forests even if trash fishing has been avoided. For consumers, however, we can look elsewhere.

John Chadima resigned his post as senior associate athletic director at UWMadison earlier in January after the allegations surfaced. The allegations were investigated by an independent panel and the report was released Tuesday night. The report alleged that Chadima made the advance in late December at a Rose Bowl party that he was throwing at a hotel in Los Angeles. There were beer and mixed drinks at the party and about 25 to 30 people attended, including employees that were under the age of 21, the report said. As the party was ending, Chadima asked one student to stay behind and have a drink with him. The two each had three rum drinks. The report called the student, who is over the age of 21, John Toe. ""Chadima told John Toe that he thought that Toe might be gay,"" the report says. ""Chadima reached over and removed Toe's parts belt and then inserted his hand inside Toe's parts on his genitals.

36,"(cnn) Returning home from the London 2012 Paralympics, James discovered the level of U.S. media coverage for a global sports event. Men's days of competition, 21 sports, and 503 events crammed into five and a half hours of coverage. To think that we have 27 athletes who just returned home after representing Team USA at the largest Paralympics in history, where 2.7 million tickets were sold, and most Americans did not even know about it. That hits home personally, not only because I am a Paralympian, but because four and a half years ago I was like most Americans and did not know about the Paralympics. Opinion: The Paralympics were brilliant, why weren't you watching? Before I was paralyzed, I did not so much as know the word Paralympics even existed. I was raised in a well educated household in Minnesota, but I knew nothing about the Paralympics until after my paralysis in 2008. After I was paralyzed swimming saved me; swimming gave me hope again and allowed me to believe in what my future could hold. From disaster to triumph: A week in the life of Pallor Weggemann. Swimming, and being involved in the Paralympics, changed my life and changed me as a person. Silent voices. I saw how getting involved in not only the Paralympics, but athletics changed my life. I have heard countless stories of the amazing abilities that my fellow Team USA teammates displayed. But how many of them were and are heard? How many Paralympians are household names in the United States? Are many households aware of the Paralympics? The biggest difference I noticed though was the appreciation for Paralympic athletes overseas. During the Paralympics, when I left the village and went into London, people knew about the James, not just knew about them but respected them and were following them. The media coverage was totally different there. You could not turn on the television without seeing it, much like it is during the Olympics here in the States. For me it is my hope that I can continue to help push the Paralympic movement forward for generations of athletes to come, just as those before me paved the way for opportunities I have been fortunate enough to experience. It is a weird feeling being back home. Years of waiting and working and just like that it is all over. I have spent time at home unpacking and organizing my things and it feels like yesterday I was packing my bags for the start of this adventure. I trained for four and a half years and it is already over. I am back home and making plans as to what I do next, starting to plan my next four years as I begin training for the Rio 2016 James. Overcoming adversity. I will be honest, coming home from London is not what I expected it to be. My goal was to come home as the James' most successful athlete and my goal was to bring home nine gold medals. When I got on the plane to return to Minnesota, I carried one gold medal and one bronze, but I carried them with pride. That I had to go through to earn both of those medals makes them more meaningful than nine golds ever could be. That medal represents more than just a winning performance. That one gold medal represents hope, belief, overcoming adversity, a dream and my supporters who backed me throughout the entire journey. When I look at it I see everything I went through to get it, the up and the down, the joy and the pain. When I look at my gold medal, I see a dream that I made four and a half years ago and the journey it took to achieve that dream. In life we all make plans. He has this idea of how things are supposed to go and when they do not go according to plan we often find ourselves disappointed. I feel that it is in those moments that we find who we are. Life does not go according to a plan. He can map it out, we can plan it, we can even divide it but often we find that life has a plan of its own. This past month had a plan of its own. It did not matter that I had planned that moment for the past four years, it did not matter that I had done everything in my power to try and control the situation. When the day came to a close, the plan I had envisioned was not the plan that life had for me. Bubble. Over the past few weeks, as I have tried to understand what happened and make sense of it all, I have realized everything happens for a reason. There is a reason I was classified in London, there is a reason life threw me another curve ball, and there is a reason I am sitting here in a wheelchair. When I came back home, I continued to reflect on London and felt many emotions. As an athlete I have put a lot of thought into what I can do differently next time. What can I change in my preparations over the next four years before the Rio 2016 James? I have also found myself settling back into life. When I was in London, we as athletes were in this little bubble, the village. He was away from the real world in many ways. He did not think of what day of the week it was or what the date was, we thought of what day of competition it was. Most of us were cut off from the real world because our lovely cell phone did not work internationally. But then we return home and real life hits.

While the machine goes into overdrive and the wheels of change are supposedly set in motion, cycling attempts to lift the specter of Dance. Armstrong still remains.. A man who won the Your de France on seven occasions, brought the sport to its knees last January after finally admitting he hoped, following years of denying the allegation. Earlier this year, Armstrong revealed he used testosterone and human growth hormone, as well as EPO, a hormone naturally produced by human kidneys, to stimulate red blood cell production.. His seven consecutive victories between 1999-2005 came amidst rumor and speculation that he was running But its failure to catch Armstrong remains an albatross around its neck, despite McQuaid vehemently insisting his organization is not to blame. ""I look back on a rider who was as well as many others at that period, cheating and getting away with it because So I don't blame the UCI. I don't blame the AFLD (French antidoping agency) or USADA or anyone else. ""The system wasn't strong enough and they were using products that couldn't be caught with the system. ""The system is a lot stronger now and so I look back on an athlete and it's not just Dance Armstrong, many of his counterparts were doing the same thing because they could get away with it. Disillusioned. However McQuaid's position as president of the UCI is under huge strain with opponents desperate to displace him. Cycling Ireland refused to back its home candidate for September's UCI elections, while a recent management committee meeting in Merged, Norway, was a fiery affair. A rosier complied by a private investigator on McQuaid was reportedly put forward to the committee, with the Irishman blocking any attempts to discuss it on the opening day of the meeting. The document was eventually discussed and although its contents have not been made public, it represented another blow to McQuaid's reelection hopes. While McQuaid has denied all knowledge of Armstrong's activities, both he and the UCI have come in for criticism following the publication of a huge detrimental report from the USADA last October. The report raised question marks over whether the UCI had a role in covering up positive tests, an allegation which McQuaid strenuously denied. When pressed by CNN on whether the UCI covered up suspicious samples from Armstrong, McQuaid replied: ""To."" Absolutely not. After being quitted on how he could be sure, McQuaid added: ""Because we know, we've studied, we know what we've done and we know, we have looked into all of this even since."" ""He has prepared, we have prepared a big number of files for the independent commission that we were going to present to the independent commission and all those questions that you've asked there are all answered in those files. ""I think he (Armstrong) was tested 1015 times during the Your de France. We did all we could to help. Those samples were sent away and they came back negative. The UCI wasn't the only antidoping agency, so to speak, who was testing Armstrong. ""I mean everybody was testing him and they were coming back negative and in that situation one has to say that the situation isn't strong enough and it wasn't at that time but today the system is much stronger and much better. But McQuaid is facing a challenge for the leadership from British cycling chief Brian Woodson, who has grown disillusioned with the Irishman's tenure. It follows a catalogue of perceived errors by the UCI, including the acceptance of a $100,0 donation from Armstrong in 2002 four years before McQuaid took up his role. The money was used by the UCI to buy a Sysmex machine, a contraction which is used to analyze blood samples. It is a decision which McQuaid conceded should not have been made. ""I would say and we have said, we have admitted that in insight and of course insight is an exact science that it would have been better had we not accepted those,"" he said. But we took them at that time in good faith and we used them for the uses that we said we had put them to. Woodson has been heavily critical of the way McQuaid has led the UCI and has pledged to restore faith in the organization. He has promised to create a completely new independent antidoping unit, which would work alongside the World AntiDoping Agency (WADA). Heat. McQuaid, who is aiming to secure a third term in office, remains philosophical about the future and the battle against it. ""Nobody is silly enough to say that you're 100% confident that the skeleton is 100% clean,"" added the UCI president. That's just not possible. It's not going to be possible in any sport or in any part of society, but certainly I think the large majority of cyclists are now going into their careers, not wanting to get involved in doing. And there's evidence of many riders who come from strong tears, with strong antidoping background, winning races and when they get across, you know, when they're doing their press conferences, they are saying I'm an example of how you can win a race clean. I don't think it'll ever be beaten because in every part of society there are cheats. There are people who look for a shortest, who try to win by serious means or whatever. ""Whether it's cheating by taking drugs or cheating in any other fashion, there are always going to be people like that in societyAnd in sport There is one avenue which remains open to McQuaid though a route which involves Armstrong. The opportunity to talk to the disgraced cycling community in a bid to improve control remains a possibility and McQuaid is refusing to rule out such a move. ""He certainly has more knowledge,"" he said of Armstrong.

However, the ASA said both the World Health Organisation and the Department of Health have found no evidence of a causal link between MR and cancer. The ASA ruled: ""Consumers were likely to infer from the claim, that the real increase in the number of children with cutis was not just down to increased diagnosis, but the vaccine might have played a role in bringing about that increase. They added: ""Because we had not seen supporting evidence that was the case, and understood that position was also contradicted by general medical opinion, we concluded that the claim was misleading.

""The group on this ship is incredibly collegiate,"" said Took Ha, a science correspondent for The Guardian newspaper, told Anderson Cooper 360.

That includes English and Spanish classes, Ha and Turned, said Turned out, it was raining hard Monday, and visibility was deteriorating. The forecast for the next 24 hours called for more of the same.. Officials said a helicopter from a nearby Chinese ship will be used in the airline, but rescue must wait for conditions to improve.. In preparation, crew members of the Akademik Shokalskiy, have marked a spot on the ice where the helicopter can land, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority said. The helicopter,, which can transport 12 people each trip,, will take the ship's 52 passengers, who include the research team and journalists to the Chinese icebreaker Due Long. An Australian icebreaker, which tried successfully to reach the research vessel, will send a barge to pick them up. The crew members of the Akademik Shokalskiy will stay aboard, the maritime agency said. ""People are sort of seeing the end in sight and just keeping morale up,"" Turned told CNN. It's New Dear's Ve tonight, so there are all sorts of plans. That includes the singing of an original song written by one of the passengers and dancing, Ha said.

It was about 100 nautical miles east of the French base Dumont D'Neville, which is about 1,500 nautical miles south of Hobart, Tasmania. On Christmas morning, the ship sent a satellite distress signal after conditions failed to clear. The Australian icebreaker Aurora Australia suspended efforts early Monday to reach the expedition because of bad weather. The ship got within 10 nautical miles but then turned back. The attempt by the Australian icebreaker followed one by the Due Long, or Now Dragon, which was six nautical miles from the wrapped vessel when it couldn't get any closer because of the ice.

Starting four months before the birth, she took birth control pills and a breastmilk enhancing drug called Domperidone. The drug does not yet have FDA approval, but is prevalent in Europe, some of states, and Canada, where Reid and Maryellen eventually bought their dosage. Experience: The couple from Santa Cruz, California, said it has made them stronger as a family. Journey: Maryellen (right) started taking birth control pills and a drug called Domperidone four months before Reid (left) gave birth to Sequoia on November 7. They conceived using artificially disseminated donor speak. Maryellen stopped the birth control pills six weeks before Reid's due date, to make her body believe she had given birth, and started ""jumping"" up to six times a day. The pump is designed to make a woman's body produce more milk. By the time Sequoia was born on November 7, Maryellen was ready to nurse. They will continue with Domperidone and verbal tablets called 'More Silk Special Lend' until Sequioa is no longer breastfeeding. Our friends are fascinated by the fact that my wife and I both breastfed our daughter,' Reid, a 26-year-old nurse, said. He gets a lot of: ""Now, that's amazing!"" and ""I didn't know that was possible!"" It came after a long battle to conceive. Reid endured a headlong battle with endometriosis and ovarian cysts that threatened to affect her fertility. In spring this year, she was finally able to undergo an intrauterine dissection (IUI) to plant a donor's speak in her uterus. But it took ten cycles before the pregnancy test flashed pink. It was a heart wrenching time and very hard on us both. Reid said. Very cycle and negative test was harder than the last, and the doctors were less and less hopeful. Birth: Having followed the meticulous program, Maryellen was able to nurse Sequoia as soon as she was born. Boy: They celebrated the birth at their family home and say they are already easing into their nursing routine. Our positive pregnancy test came just in the nick of time, and we were so glad.' Now, four weeks after their home birth, photographers from Santa Cruz Birth Photography, Reid, Maryellen and Sequoia are easing into their conventional routine. For Sequoia, it means she doesn't have to wait around even though she is sometimes stubborn ('she really makes us work for it!'). 'He doesn't really have a set schedule or rotation,' Maryellen said. Whoever is near the baby or holding her will feed her, and the other will try to pump then or shortly after.'He is able to sleep in longer chinks due to this, since it's not all on one mamma to have to feed her and stay awake He switches whenever the awake mamma feels like she needs help or sleep.' Makes everything easier! Both nursing, which means either can respond to Sequoia's cries if the other is busy. But the crucial benefit is their connection. Maryellen said: “For me, I am able to feel even closer to her. I am absolutely in love with her and feel incredibly connected to her ever since she was in utero, but since she's been out of the womb and I'm breastfeeding, I feel even more connected. I know other noncarrying lesion mothers who feel like they are not as close to their child as the mon who carried the baby, and I know that breastfeeding has helped me feel incredibly bonded to her. When she is breastfeeding and falls asleep on me or lays her hand on me, I feel an overwhelming amount of love for her that I wouldn't have would I not be breastfeeding.","Reid and Maryellen Elson conceived their first daughter using donor speak.nHeidi gave birth to Sequoia on Sept. 7, Maryellen wanted to breastfeed too.nMaryellen followed a program of birth control pills and a milkenhancing drug for three months before"

Grandmother Barbara Allons, of Mosborough, South Yorkshire, bought the two two-seater armchairs from Parleys Furniture Tore three years ago and says they have always had problems. The company has sent her several spare parts but after repeated complaints they finally called at her home to fix them. A furniture shop refused to repair armchairs owned by Barbara Allons (pictured) after claiming she had ruined them with sweat caused by her meditation.

Mrs Allons said: 'I'm upset about it. People will think I'm dirty and I'm not dirty. They will think my house is scruffy. That makes me so cross is that they're saying these chairs are greasy. I'm really hurt by what they've made me look. If they didn't want to fix the chairs, why couldn't they use a problem with the furniture as an excuse? Instead they've made a personal attack on me and my health. People will think ""what's wrong with her?""

Mrs Allons, a retired axillary nurse, had applied for the chairs to be repaired by the shop. But the worker who visited her home asked her whether she was diabetic or on any blood pressure medication, to which she replied 'yes'. She said she later found this was used as a reason not to fix the chairs, which she said had been plagued with problems. Mrs Allons added: 'It's a load of rubbish.

47,"Bony says it will release the Beth RogenJames Franco comedy'The Interview' mere days after it announced the film would not be in theaters for its scheduled Christmas release date. Bono canceled the film's release last week after the hawkers threatened real-world attacks on cinema screenings. 'Bony only delayed this,' said company attorney David Does on today's NBC's Feet the Dress. Roll down the video. Bony says it will in fact publicly release the Beth RogenJames Franco comedy'The Interview' despite threats from hawkers. 'Bony only delayed this,' said company attorney David Does on NBC's Feet the Dress. President Drama later said Bony had made a mistake in concealing the movie, and that he would have intervened to make sure it went ahead. The hawkers leaned on an embarrassing email between Bony Pictures chair My Rascal and producer Scott Ruin, joking in a socially insensitive manner about Drama's film tastes. Bond has been fighting to get this picture distributed, he said, according to The Daily Least. It will be distributed. The vast majority of cinema chains which were set to screen the movie, pulled it after the threats. That came after a series of embarrassing internal documents were made public, from plans for the coming James Fond film, to internal emails arguing over the company's direction, to discussion of past theatrical failures. Rascal has been especially embarrassed by the leads, recently having an email released revealing that things are so bad between the actor and the studio in fact that Bony head My Rascal calls him an'a**hole* not once, but twice in email exchanges. The HawkersLeaned an embarrassing email between Bony Pictures chair My Rascal and producer Scott Ruin joking in a socially insensitive manner about Drama's film tastes. Actress Angelina Police was also gripped in some of the email exchanges with My Rascal, seen here together at a Women in Entertainment Breakfast in L.A. They also believed Boris Elba should be cast as the next James Fond. Meanwhile, Angelina Police was referred to as a'a minimal talented spoiled brat' in one exchange discussing the star's passion project made of Cleopatra. Calls the backs of a state sponsored criminal attack on an American corporation and its employees. Bony has been glad for the FBI's help in investigating the hack, and the rest of the government has got to get behind it and has got to figure out a way that we can protect our national security. As Box notes, one viable option to get the movie out would be Crackle, the streaming service that Bony already owns. However, Does was ensured that viewers would finally be able to see the film. Bono canceled The Interview's December 25 release last week after the hawkers threatened real-world attacks on cinema screenings. Now it is going to be distributed, I do not think anybody knows quite yet,' he said. But it is going to be distributed. This weekend, North More threatened more attacks against the U.S. government and other American institutions in the wake of the hack on Bony, which cancelled the release of The Interview. Drama also announced there was consideration to put the rogue state back on the list of state sponsors of terrorists. The government, which was outraged by the film showing the assassination of leader Him Long In, also claimed to have ""clear evidence"" that the U.S. government engineered the project as a "" propaganda "" attack against North More. Drama also announced there was consideration to put the rogue state back on the list of state sponsors of terrorists. In a granting post published by the state news agency KCNA, Organ authorities hit back in an excavating war of words in which they say they will'blow up' the White House while bizarre, continuing to deny they have anything to do with the saber attacks on Bon North More called the hack a'righteous deed' and reiterated that it'highly esteem' the attack but said it had no idea where it came from.","Bony only delayed this,' said company attorney David Does on NBC's Feet the Dress.No one canceled The Interview's December 25 release last week after the hawkers threatened real-world attacks on cinema screening it.Nail could be made available on Crackle,"

Darling,. Come a little closer and let me whisper in your darling ears, all these loving words, because they are meant for. you, my sweetheart.. The pair wrote a series of remarkable and passionate love letters to one another throughout World War II. The amazing collection of 250 letters, telegrams, notes and Valentine's cards was stored in a tea chest. The couple, who shared the same birthday, kept the memories smashed away inside a tea chest in their home in Innate, County Durham. Speaking about the letters, Vilna Truce, the show's host, said: ""Theirs was a real love story.

In another passage he adds: "" He both feel the same when I have to return from leave. I have to take a firm hold of myself or I would never come back.

Elizabeth's communication is more limited, as she was kept in the dark about where her husband was to keep military operations a secret.

49,"(cnn) Mon was always sports mad, my dad not so much. But both my parents understood the importance of significant events, so when opportunity knocked, my parents opened up all the doors for me. I grew up knowing full well that my country wasn't allowed to participate in international sports following the sporting boycott of 1977 which had been placed on South Africa in a protest against apartheid a system of racial aggregation enforced by the ruling white minority. When the South African rugby team toured New Zealand in 1981, my parents made sure that I was awoken at 04:30 to watch all three West matches. I got to struggle with my parents first putting the television in their bedroom. It was the ""flour boy West"" where a light aircraft flew over Auckland's Den Dark before and during the match, dropping flour bombs, smoke bombs and antiapartheid leaflets where I began to realize that other countries didn't like us. I didn't understand why at the time, and it hurt a little. Later that day, I'll never forget my parents telling me that it could be a long time before I witnessed something like this again. I was six at the time. They were right; I would next see these two tears play as a 17-year-old. First trip. The first trip to Gape Down's Newlands Cricket Round was to watch Western Province play a domestic match. It must have been my mon's first trip too, because I distinctly remember entering the ground and ending up sitting on the grass embankment, which was reserved for colored people. Confused, we sat down. A kind couple offered us some fruit, so we stayed. I was blissfully unaware of how significant this possibly was. He returned a couple of years later to watch my first ""West"" match: South Africa vs. the West Indies. His time we were seated in the correct place, in the Oaks Enclosure, which ironically these days is a grass embankment. I remember the hope and the excitement about this special day. I had seen the Indies in their warm game against Western Province and I knew that they were something special. They had vicious fast boilers and flamboyant boatmen. He got there early, along with thousands of others, just to watch the warmups. The excitement was tangible. I don't remember much about the games, I remember more about the players. They were heroes to us. Perhaps there was some curiosity too, something about the islands from far, far away on our shores. He used to follow them around the boundaries of the ground, hunting their prized autographs. And their accents are just too cool. Didn't see color. I know I didn't see the color. I don't think most kisses were just crickets. At the end of play we would run on the field to try to touch them and grab one more autograph. Somewhere there is a forage of me congratulating Sylvester Clarke by patting his back. I remember telling all my friends that I had touched the great cowler. While I had forgotten about it, listening to Franklin Stephenson speak reminded me of the time we were trying to get him to drink from some kid's Joke. He obliged and we all simply went crazy. I realize the significance of that event now. Imagine a black guy drinking from the same can? Perhaps our parents would have slipped out, but this wasn't about color to us. Other memories include how obliging and friendly they were. Happy to give autographs and happy to interact positively with the huge crowds. Branded a rebel. It was with incredible interest and fascination that I watched ""Branded a Rebel"", a CNN World Port documentary which first screened last year. It gave me greater insight into the players, the tour, West Indies cricket and indeed my home country. And while ""Branded a Rebel"" is an appropriate title for the program, it could have just as easily been title ""Branded Heroes"". That's what they were to us white South Africans, and I think deep down the Indies players felt that too. Its all about which side of the line you were sitting on, I guess. In their return home, the West Indian players were shunned by society and some were forced to move abroad to make a living. The poverty and other such ills which befell some of their players really tugged at all of my emotions. I started thinking what we as South Africans could have done for them. Would we have done more? Did we look after them well enough after the fact? It's a difficult one. These men didn't deserve it, no matter what choice they made. Society can be cruel. Tangled by hatred. It eats me up to think what those players endured upon their return. They were strangled by such hatred in their home countries, and yet I wish they somehow knew what they had done for young cricket fans like me. I got to see ""real"" international cricket played at the ""highest"" level. I got to meet new cricket greats. I got to bowl like Clarke, Polls King and Olin Front. I got to emulate David Murrays great wicketkeeping skill on Clinton Beach, a field like Plain Kallicharan, and admire the patience and wasteful patting of the great Lawrence Owe. And something else they taught us not to take ourselves too seriously by showing how much one can enjoy themselves on the sports field. Their smiles, I'll never forget their smiles. Each of their names is entrenched in my memory, and of all of those who saw the matches. They became part of my upbringing and that of thousands of South African fans. That I didn't understand at the time, was what it took for those men to actually land on our shores (money aside). They must have been really scared. I know I would have been. In the interview with Live Lloyd, longtime captain of the official West Indies team that dominated world cricket for two decades, he said no amount of money would have made him support a racist regime.I would go as far as to say no amount of money would have put my fears at ease to travel Courage. It's not for me to judge, but those men were courageous. In their cricket and in their collective decisions, and I respect that. A few years later, I did wonder how the black West Indian players got to travel using ""white"" transport and stay in ""white"" areas. I remember asking my mon how that worked. I didn't know, but you could see that my political curiosity was growing. I was disappointed that more players didn't take up the opportunity to interview for the documentary. I was intrigued by Stephenson, King and Murrays thoughts, motives and effective answers. There seemed no real regret, which was fascinating and pleasing for some reason. For those who declined an interview, their wounds obviously cut deep. Stephenson was just how I remember him. Boisterous, bubbly and always looking on the bright side of life. He got to know him well here, as he returned to play for the Range Free State. The fact that he still has all his memorabilia means that the tour meant something to him, and that he feels part of change and change in attitudes in South Africa. I don't know if they changed us as a society but I'd like to think so, even if it was an indescribable fractured and dysfunctional society. And by this I mean that white South Africa packed out every cricket ground to watch Black West Indies, went home and made sure that ""The Rosy How"" was the most watched program on television and yet black people were pretty much denied and excluded from everything. Heart bleeds. ""Branded a rebel"" showed balanced reporting. I like the fact that you saw the tour from a South African perspective as well. Great players like Frame Hillock, Carry Richard and Live Vice also effectively served Life Bank for being, well, South African, and the program understood that. I know that, fundamentally, the tour was morally corrupt, but for an innocent nineyear-old devoid of political allegiance and beliefs, it was simply a chance to see the world's best crickets entertaining us on the world's most beautiful stage. Ultimately, I'd also like to believe that South African cricketers and administrators were trying to show the government the way forward, and that unity through sport was possible.","A ban to campaign against apartheid in South Africa was introduced in 1977.n""Rebel hours"" were highly controversial, unofficial, international matches.near of West Indian cricket players visited South Africa in 1983.they were shunned by society on their return home to"
