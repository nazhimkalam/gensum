shogun meets dances wolves,movie almost certainly appeal persons like action films quasi historical epics found movie generally interesting entertaining movie however historical epic quite lacking plot movie especially character played tom cruise often reminded shogun television miniseries film dances wolves ending also reminded charge light brigade starring errol flynn also think last samurai tends somewhat overly romanticize samurai japan 1860 people honestly debate whether film significant historical inaccuracies justly merit criticism andor overall less favorable review action movie would rate last samurai four stars however many reasons considerable reservations unrealistic character played kevin costner dances wolves give last samurai three stars last samurai certainly worth watching however army officer played tom cruise detracts historical validity film negative reaction many samurai modernization efforts japan late 1860 movie would potentially better opinion samurai story told entirely japanese point view

doubt back,bad expecting certainly worst terminator movie salvation got action chases explosions one really could care less characters women worst good know though near apocalyptic future women still hot shampoo available abundance makeup annoying recent trend movies knew terminators got within hair targets likely toast iii specially get john connor often grab shirt throw air miraculously lands soft surface unfortunately skynet recent terminators seem dumb figure going get job done anytime soon wonder sense excitement pretty much gone series

salvation terminator flick,let begin saying big terminator fan loved three previous films third weakest opinion even loved way television series true mythology terminator though terminator salvation stay true mythology terms characters location historic story developmentit simply fell short mcg okay directorthough thing really half like charlies angels full throttle cast outstanding put good performancebut overall story film wanting unlike previous terminator outings film fighting futureinstead film futuristic fight terminator story line simplified futuristic war movie get wrongit kind cool see war machines live actionbut could done make story follow mythology feel like terminator film quite literally could called film transformers would good need future unknown changing chasing present one coolest things terminator movie franchise one things desperately missing filmand keeps fitting comfortably terminator seriesi literally felt robbed film film feel like terminator moviebut said done viewer realize nothing set squeal failure production team get idea terminator mythos correct devastating movie shotty writing reliance spacial effects carry film downfall short movie allot popcorn funbut bad terminator movie
first movies great 4th absolute disapointment,terminator disgrace terminator series movie focus war fans expected see explain john connor becomes leader show qualifications leader whole story focuses stupid guy considered decommissioned terminator near end guy talking jumbo computer wich lame reminds computer system irobot kyle reese character also young extremly wimpy come john connor going send little guy back past mom even expain send back portal whatever man movie totally awful
terminator salvation blue ray fails deliver quality,first blue ray disc bought say terminator salvation movie poorly mastered could tell difference blue ray film old regular dvd quality film even broadcast looks better tvstory mediocre special effects would better real movie instead crap full unprocessed picture noise
quite train wreck expecting,read number reviews movie especially star ratings rented train wreck expecting introduction different types terminators nice concept point terminators knew t800 t1000 terminator humanoid movie introduces far differentthe story holds true previous movies katherine brewster john connor wife planet look nearly devastated nuclear war previous movies seems lot military survived war spoiler previous movies john connor protected everybody time around kyle reese guarded protect time line introduction marcus character particularly cared seemed addon main save kyle reese story line helena bonham carter interesting skynet robot feel also disappointed time travel aspect left movie wanted see resistance going seize time travel equipment send back kyle digitalization arnold face t800 cheesy looking appreciated since saw terminator back 1984it worth watching however sure add dvd collection jury till moment
great new addition terminator franchise,terminator salvation beginning new saga terminator franchise begun 1984 james cameron hit terminator directed mcg takes place fifteen years events terminator rise machines ended onslaught judgment day day world machines rose humanityjohn connor time played christian bale settled prophetized role resistance leaderonly hope humanity terminator machines yet connor struggles mission great emancipatorwarrior bale shows internal strife well get know connor ragtag group rebels see two people entering life play major roles fight marcus played sam worthington death row inmate several years ago took part scientific procedure kyle reese well portrayed anton yelchin reese course one day becomes father john earlier terminator mythos yet john tasked finding keeping alive alternate time framethough always lively fast paced earlier schwarzenegger films well produced set pieces aftermath judgment day led new chapter connor life fulfillment savior humanity somehow still works without presence schwarzenegger simply takes story different direction adds new layers original mythologythe film looks great bluray strong visuals clear soundtrack enough enhance mcg vision good addition one best scifi sagas ever made
postjudgement day entertainment,convolute review terminator salvation opinions films series terminator mythology simply say even stand alone film terminator salvation good sure driven degree special effects action choice little bits tossed longtime fans found entertaining wellmade film story good also foretold leader resistance machines john connor main character though role insignificant film focuses newlyintroduced character marcus wright whose part film serves interesting standard comparison john connor survived judgement day seen war would say terminator salvation metallic singleminded killing machines great action obligatory explosions though certainly lacking things ultimately story moral responsibility strength character humanity subjects play perspective marcus well connor neither character comes onedimensionalreally making attempt avoid spoiling film exaggerate themes boiled basics solid action film fueled great special effects terminator still unique frightening movie monster john connor brave man struggling seemingly impossible odds add mix marcus wright man shameful past unexpected second chance worthwhile film characters want believe follow throughout course storyline yes fairly vague encourage anyone much even considered seeing film give chance anyone plain appreciates welldone action movie magic creepy humanexterminating robots future pass terminator salvation eithernow done best make case movie address something else bluray version get pg13 theatrical version film rrated director cut watched say pg13 version really lesssatisfying rrated version seem add much adult content even warrant upped rating would say three previous terminator films bloodier course film action thriller makes sense worst thing added rrated version salvation brief female nudity
much director cut,stars like movie director cut others stated maybe minutes added scenes enough make movie changer personally think could kept pg13 rating
something watch nothing pay,glad waste money film story line confusing film really explain main characters got past present whatever time main character movie father teenager one point sure son traveled past father futurei know kind scardy cats watched film wrote reviews think robots scarycreepy plot predictable could possibly scared knew going happen alreadyanyway something watch cold night especially want complete series although think original characters one robots end look like arnold long reduced metal skeletonmy advice save money rent wait til cable
much personality flickmore like video game,movie action talk well talk action intense story variety scenes movie suffers greatly sam worthington plays charactermarcusthat seems come nowhere mention three previous terminator movies movie seems mostly even centered around john conner getting hooked hot babe desert really corny soap operaish machine crying loudi hoping movie would center around start relationship kyle reese john conner markus dude played noble character thought unnecessary addition grand terminator tale hopefully next sequel hone reese conner moreas lot action movies days flick lot charm variety entirely fault screenwriters course since setting postarmageddon everyone living like savages constant misery fearnot lot room comic relief witty oneliners terminator course ahnold linda hamilton sorely missed well obviously flick going allaround entertaining terminator thought scenes resistance fighting machines looked straight xbox ps3 game exuding vibe feel playing video game fine teenage boys sure would rather movie seem like regular movie overallso hardcore terminator movie fans would recommend adding movie collection would call musthave either
fairly solid movie almost ruined poor ending,spoilersi pretty good time movie special effects solid storyline fairly cohesive sam worthington performance strong fully expected marcus survive movie arrived back rebel camp pleasantly surprised survived fight skynet massive huge let volunteering heart save john connor really irritating part john nodding like good show old chap make good use marcus every bit much right life compelling character film would made excellent torch bearer carry fight could breathed new life series get stupid ending bale set another sequelfor saying would ruin congruity salvation previous films connor already stated mother recordings make mention terminator could explained time line unexpectedly shifting john connor died marcus lived last minute rewrite spoiled film

creepy quite red dragon,let start saying film manhunter fairly good adaptation book brian cox portrays mellower hannibal lecktor performance good energetic perfect face antagonist evil however show much film therefore scary opinion obviously killed people obviously insanity comes back haunt semiretired detective graham recollection explanation hannibal cannibalistic murders since know much character less scary regardless brian cox good performance get wrong hannibal still really awesome movie graham thought portrayed well haunted past lecktor working case disturbed must dig deep within mind serial killer loose order figure mystery main problem sticks movie serial killer francis dolarhyde red dragon played well real sense psyche much explanation brutally murdering people admiration red dragon painting mentioned twice throughout movie aside flaws manhunter wellmade film creepy images delightful entertainment strange different thriller depends implied violence rather graphic violence problem always get full look horror story still would recommend fun watch see little differences superior 2002 version red dragon creepy entertaining films
movie great book,knew red dragon first hannibal trilogy bought finished reading loved decided rent dvd well good well acted well directed writing changed really good ending book one movie thought movie huge silence lambs fan read book

even know movie existed,people call silence lambs first one hannibal sequel although ilence consistent probably better ending like movie better ways william peterson plays intense monotonous wil graham forced retirement find killer two families wil seeks help hannibal lector played brian cox plot basically silence although cox nearly much screen time hopkins wil tells son lector killed women bad ways opposed good ways since directed miami vice michael mann dennis farina plays jack crawford midwestern accent intact role taken scott glen ilence first fortyminutes perfect gruesome crime scenes strong plot wheelchairbound body engulfed flames unfortunately think movie sags places eventually runs gas would much better without horrible music gadda vida take leave another thing bothers always make psycho killers superhuman shoot times fall graham semidescent back near insanity unconvincing almost cheesy despite flaws remains one best thrillers around thrillers thrilling first saw impressionable teenager impact diminished hear going remake update interesting

interesting journey,saw film quite liked cannot rate dvd journey people africa truly amazing cannot imagine would like experience first hand thankfully film takes journey well worth seeing
unhappy amazon,never actually received dvd paid amazon although emailed numerous times try tell never received response waste money
dissapointing say least,unless interested challenges posed introducing number displaced youth grown extremely deprived disjointed society united states movie youif take child deprived regions world transplant environment modern conveniences societal norms would challenges faced sudanese kids need refugees firstthe intriguing phenomenon entire film obvious mistrust lack connection poor africanamericans poor africans beyond color skinfor part situation exists workingclass africans africanamericans lumped coexist work home therefore nothing new unless different race
pretty good intense intro movie dinosaurs,scary dink friends often chased trex roars like lion yet son really wantsneeds watch animation done hannabarbera studios childhood video contains stories dink friends adventures little dinosaurs stories teach simple lessons helping others dangers practical jokes although basically think video fine would preferred something less intense say son would prefer though

amazing train crash scene,vastly overrated outing overrated director abrams hasbeen steven spielberg film gotten success two names alone therefore sake nonbias review simply forget forget movie connection whatsoever old steve take film right see perhaps overrated film 2011 remember teaser trailers leading release would say vastly vague revealed almost nothing except creepy music lot darkness reason attempt create buzz film filmmakers knew nothing really work type trailer would simply revealed every details movie matter minutes honestly time need reveal every plot device film actually offersthe film stars group noname teenage actors growing late 1970 middle creating lowbudget zombie film train station scene changes lives witness come head giant train crash holding alien military trying keep wraps teens escape knowledge pursued said military film basically delves continuous desperate attempt try create characters really never end truly caring plot drones stretching suspense never achieving later semiclimactic final scene aliens escape really never get know happens kids movie endsthe biggest problem film spielberg try take various elements would equate heartwarming movie middle schoolers puppy love simpler time generation quiet midwestern town etc try toss strange antagonist mix things never actually using attributes anything worthwhile spielberg seem forget elements alone create enjoyable film need good script also mention better actors words cute get noname teenage actors feel realistic instead hiring lindsay lohan cast high school musical put performances really break ground play parts well enough never hold chemistry magic many times even given opportunity simply act wooden slabs displaying forced puppy love crushes social tension never works hardly ever believable sure cute pretty girl definitely pull mystery girl heartmelting smile well things ruined forced monologues things never touched upon way film except part kids telling example one drawn monologue said pretty girl going memory childhood watching film dark room kid going gaga forced tears fool anyone care spielberg says featurettes boring useless nothing enhance character see elements actually talking monologue kids even seem parents put another way character talk things life like cry stretch make dramatic things talking seen way whatsoever throughout movieanother minus militaryairforcewhatever trying keep area alien wraps course fail even though aliens supposed villains military issue aliens make well known enough scared dislike desire see die villains written film well enough except scenes rarr scared alien bad guy movie rarrr sorry enough moreover militaryairforce guys nice anything makes dislike see reason whatsoever even rooting obnoxious kids hence really feel bad guys filmto make one last point time era film takes place also near unbelievable sure 1979 things much different given suburb point made well enough cannot tell whether bad props enough atmosphere helping really believe really 1979 film like born fourth july tom cruise late 80s made feel like recent hit help well forest gump films highlight time era thus making believable way making characters genuine likable adds problem way kids movie speak speak like kids grew 1970s act correctly terms body language rather speak way modern carry sort sarcastic tongueincheek attitude would expect kid growing 2000 obviously abrams young even know children acted 70s perhaps spielberg could written directed bit film least experience time created classic filmsspielberg abrams like boast film done pay homage old scifi thrillers past besides honestly think anyone really cares mean even seen old movies besides diehard movie buffs forking film earnings want pay homage fine least make good movie good scriptanyway aside lack characterization plot goes nowhere military scenes involving guys trying cover whole thing never interesting never plot twists among characters things play exactly would expect throughout movie ending well ends actually remember fighting fall asleep last half hour filmone reviewer states feels like bigbudget disney film true movie seems want impress adults incorporating childhood charm none especially dumb alien storyline always getting way movie simply feels like bigbudget film could premiered disney one may intended ages adults simply feel

lacked good direction many thrilling scenes throughout although still worked mostly contained good story abrams got overrated director alive today seems well simply american audiences fall easily bigbudget films little substance star trek made good film contain good number flaws namely lame boring enemy get super also get good word legendary directors thus people simply fork money say enjoyed film cannot see past special effects show substandard characterization predictable scriptwhile super terrible definitely overrated comes average runofthemill alien flick starring kids ever remember

train wreck,film kind lost train wrecki seen train hit truck fact box truck pickup train swatted truck aside continued derailing single car crash though train hit immovable wall propelling huge freight cars air though weightless least hit groundspeilberg love cgibut make movie
worst movie,wanted like mean names like speilberg abrams thought would great huge fringe fan movie lacked vitality kids okay plot line weak acting poor never seemed work anywayfor bluray action scenes particularly train accident could much intensesadly taught cautious future movies names attached
high hopes disappointed,train derailment outskirts small ohio town unleashes mysterious creature amid resulting chaos small group kids little comingofage dramafor first hour thought watching 5star film kids working amateur movie local film festival hilarious touching unfortunately quality film deteriorates conventions scifi action plot assert abilities creature illdefined seems able whatever convenient plot naturalistic kids become unconvincing action movie heroes way best scenes derailed even spectacularly freight cars kick whole thing
missed greater story losing scenario science fiction,title movie super truly misleading could convey thing confusion moviemaker opting losing scenario movie started great coherent sequence events seemed lead masterpiece art soon train crash added great action drama quickly dissipated slightly injured truck driver disseminated unrecognizable parts regard colossal train accident followed another miscalculation part moviemaker allowing kids center collision scene survive characters irrelevant story survival serve purpose showing unnecessary exaggerationthe movie would still made glorious outcome despite reckless exaggeration surviving upheaval underlying causes train accident would made best movie ever story stayed away frank display extraterrestrial monster losing confidence judgment moviemaker made science fiction less comforting viewers eased believing fictional scenario rather suspecting foul play part moviemakingmany car engines disappeared many missing dogs equipments still less unsettling showing monster closer end movie building underground spaceship harvesting metal objects monster never shown left viewers guess features motives one could remained pondering enjoying quizzing scenario end instead feeling fooled irrational twisting events served logical
